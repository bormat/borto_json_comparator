Aguero struck twice to rack up 101 goals under the Spaniard\nand take his tally to half a dozen after just four games this season. And that\nsaw him equal a Premier League best haul for August  level with former City\nstriker Edin Dzeko, who did it in 2011, and Blackburn hotshot Chris Sutton from\n1997. Manager Guardiola purred: \"Sergio has scored goals with Argentina, in Turn\nto Page 3 Manchester City..............4 Brighton..............................0\nTON OF FUN ...

He added: \"The result was 4-0 but\nthe performance wasn't because they did really well. \"Few teams come here and\nplay with that courage. \"The difference was, as I have said many times, the\nplayers we have got up front. \"Managers like Graham Potter are very good for\nfootball. \"The credit is to Brighton. When I said they were good some people\ndidn't believe me. \"They created some problems that usually we don't have.\"\nSeagulls chief Potter agreed with Guardiola's appraisal and said: \"The result\nisn't something we enjoy but the performance was one of real courage. \"Whatever\nyou do here it's very difficult. We just wanted to try to be ourselves and test\nourselves against the very best. \"It's only our fourth game together and we\nthought it was a chance to learn and develop.

Yet Norwegian Elyounoussi would have no\nfears about being pitched straight in against Steven Gerrard's men.\n\nHe said: \"If the gaffer needs me I am ready.\n\n\"I have played derbies before but I don't think there is anything like this in\nEurope.\n\n\"I feel OK, I feel fit and I have been training hard.\n\n\"Obviously I haven't played for a long time but I feel good.\n\n\"I would like to play, of course. I have come here to make an impact and help\nthe team to win games.\n\n\"Obviously it is a big game so either way it's something I'm really looking\nforward to, whether watching or taking part.\n\n\"In Norway it was a rivalry between Molde and Rosenborg, more than a real derby.\n\n\"It was a bit friendly, no real fight or hooligans! In Basel, it was more about\nthe football as well.\n\n\"From what I have heard there's a lot of history behind everything the two clubs\ndo in Glasgow, so I've not experienced anything like that.\"\n\nElyounoussi is already known to the Celtic fans after scoring home and away in\nthe Europa League for Molde in 2015.\n\nBut he confirmed he could also have been pulling on the Hoops after Ronny Deila\nmade a move in January 2016.\n\nCeltic could not agree a fee with Molde and Elyounoussi admits he was gutted\nwhen the transfer did not materialise. He said: \"I had a good experience against\nCeltic for Molde  a goal and an assist in both games  but now I get the chance\nto do it for Celtic rather than against them.\n\n\"I also knew about Celtic's interest back then.\n\n\"From what I've heard, I was a bit too expensive.\n\n\"I can't confirm that but it's what I heard. I remember at that time I really\nwanted to come to Celtic, especially after playing at the stadium. The\natmosphere was amazing that night  until we scored.\n\n\"It was my wish to come to Celtic at that time. I would have signed if I could.\nBut it's better late than never, for sure.\"\n\nElyounoussi reckons the current Celtic side are miles ahead of that struggling\nDeila team from 2015-16.\n\nThe ace added: \"I felt like Celtic was the right choice. The club, size of club\nand the way they play football too.\n\n\"They play attacking, aggressive football. I watched games and I just liked it\ninstantly and wanted to be a part of it.\n\n\"I have come here to win games, to win titles and for myself to get better as a\nplayer.\n\n\"I know Kristoffer Ajer, Fraser Forster and other players who have been here\nlike Stuart Armstrong. They have said good things about the club.\n\n\"I'm here to become a better player and try to help the team to win titles.\nThat's all I want.\n\n\"I like the pressure of history and going for the title.\n\n\"I can compare it to my time at Basel when they had won the league seven times\nin a row.\n\n\"The pressure was huge from the fans every year, to win the league, the Cup and\ndo well in Europe.\n\n\"I liked that pressure and the challenge, so that's why I am here at Celtic  I\nwant to win more titles.\"\n\nLennon has challenged Elyounoussi to rediscover the form that saw Southampton\npay Basel £16m for him last summer.\n\nThe Norwegian flitted in and out of the team as injury and a change of manager\ntook its toll.\n\nHe said: \"It was all small details. It didn't start great because I was injured\nand it took some time.\n\n\"It was my first game and I got injured when I'd never had one in my career. I\ngot back in, then the manager got sacked, a new manager came in  a lot of\nthings went on and it was hard to get momentum.\n\n\"But I look back and try to learn from it.\"",

            "content_plain": "MAN CITY.........4 De Bruyne 2; Aguero 42, 55; B Silva 79 BRIGHTON..........0 By\nPHIL THOMAS HOME comforts, seventh heaven and a century of smiles ... Sergio\nAguero is leaving City fans spoilt for choice this season.\n\nAnother double from the champions' deadliest marksman brought up 101 goals in\n134 games under Pep Guardiola.\n\nNot bad for a guy whose workrate the gaffer doubted so much at first that he\nwent out and spent £28.6million on Gabriel Jesus.\n\nA double which made it 99 goals at the Etihad  a record just Wayne Rooney and\nThierry Henry, at Old Trafford and Highbury respectively, can better for Prem\ngoals at one venue.\n\nA double which made it six in just four matches before the end of August for the\nArgentine. And just for good measure, a double which means Aguero's last seven\nshots on target have all ended in the back of the net.\n\nAll of which ensured a fixture that on paper always looked like one of the\nbiggest mismatches you'll see all year, did indeed end up as just that.\n\nTo be fair to those who questioned Brighton's 33-1 odds  though there were not\nmany who were not Seagulls fans  it did take just 69 seconds to see why.\n\nThat is how long it took before City were ahead. That is how long before an\nuphill task became an Everest-sized one, as the first real attack brought the\nultimate reward.\n\nIndeed, you could have added a nought to Brighton's price and there still would\nnot have been many takers.\n\nThe worrying thing for them in that blink-of-an-eye opening was how easily they\nwere sliced open.\n\nThere was not a hint of onetouch, pinball-passing incision about it, either.\nJust a ball down the line from Oleksandr Zinchenko, a pull back from David Silva\nand Kevin De Bruyne nonchalantly strolling into the box to sidefoot home from\neight yards.\n\nMaybe if Shane Duffy was playing it might have been cleared? The Ireland man was\nsurprisingly left on Brighton's bench just days before the Euro 2020 qualifier\nagainst Switzerland and though one or two whispers of a minor knock did the\nrounds on social media, this was not confirmed.\n\nBack to City. Riyad Mahrez fired straight at keeper Mat Ryan after jinking\nimpishly inside, De Bruyne drilled a low fizzer a couple of feet wide and Aguero\npulled another just too far left.\n\nOh, and in between times, Kyle Walker took out the frustration of his England\naxing in a thundering 50-50 with Dale Stephens that had 50,000-plus wincing.\n\nNot half as much as they were ten minutes from the break when Aymeric Laporte\nflew into a challenge  more like an assault  to stop Adam Webster.\n\nIt certainly did that, earning a justifiable yellow card.\n\nMore worrying was the sight of Laporte leaving on a stretcher in agony, his\nright knee banged horribly in the collision.\n\nWith John Stones sidelined and no new centre-back brought in ,Pep will be\npraying the Frenchman is not too seriously injured. But the way Laporte\nimmediately flung his arm into the air for treatment and the anguish on his face\nmade it look like we are talking months rather than weeks.\n\nThat brief Brighton foray was also a reminder that, for all the City dominance,\na one-goal cushion still meant where there is life there is hope. But not for\nlong.\n\nNot after Aguero pounced for the first time in the afternoon.\n\nAnd if the opener was a pretty basic affair, this one had the Guardiola stamp\nrunning through it from start to finish.\n\nIt began with Zinchenko to Nicolas Otamendi on halfway and continued with Walker\nrolling a ball forwards from midfield.\n\nMahrez then backheeled telepathically to the right, De Bruyne delivered\nradar-like at full pace and Aguero stepped back across before smashing into the\nroof of the net.\n\nFrom that moment it became damage limitation, even if Fernandinho did have to\nhead one 50th-minute goalbound shot from Leandro Trossard to safety after a\nZinchenko rush of blood.\n\nAnother shake-from-the-slumbers warning for City? It may well have been because\na couple of minutes later it was 3-0. Zinchenko, spending more time in the\nopposition half than his own, fed Silva and when he teed up Aguero, the curled\nedge-ofthe-box strike could not have been more clinical.\n\nDe Bruyne went close to a stunning fourth when he volleyed wide but they did not\nhave long to wait for it. And in Bernardo Silva's case, just 17 seconds after\nstepping from the bench to replace namesake David.\n\nHis first burst into the box was on to Aguero's set-up, which he despatched\nacross Ryan into the far corner.\n\nTwo-horse race? If City keep up this sort of form, even that will be a tad\noptimistic.",

Just\nbefore the break Heaton superbly tipped Luka Milivojevic's free-kick around a\npost before palming Cheikhou Kouyate's header over the bar.\n\nVilla had four players booked in the first half and it was no surprise when one\nof them, Trezeguet, was sent off for a second yellow card after a foul on\nWilfried Zaha.\n\nWith a man advantage, Palace pressed in search of the breakthrough and\nMilivojevic's 25-yard curler produced a superb stop from Heaton.\n\nJust as the natives started to get a bit restless, up stepped Ayew to break the\ndeadlock with a stunning strike.\n\nThe frontman appeared to be in a cul-de-sac after running into the channel to\ncollect Schlupp's pass.\n\nBut he turned inside England newboy Tyrone Mings and Grealish before steering\nhis shot past Heaton.\n\nYou could almost taste Palace's relief. But their celebrations were almost\nspoilt when Lansbury fired a shot into the bottom corner near the end.\n\nRef Friend disallowed the goal and booked Grealish for diving in the build-up,\neven though the Villa captain did not appeal for a foul as he hit the deck under\na challenge from Gary Cahill.\n\nSTATS Villa fan Prince William  not at the game  would not have been happy.\n\nASTON VILLA off target ......2/3 shots................5 POSSESSION............\n.47% Passes..................357 CORNERS....................2 red\ncards..........4/1 But Palace will hardly care about that as they were too busy\ntoasting the King of Jordan.\n\nMATCH STATS C PALACE ASTON VILLA 5/10......Shots on/off target ......2/3\n7................Blocked shots................5 53% .............

            "content_plain": "LEICESTER........3 Vardy 12, 73; Tielemans 41 B'mouth..........1 C Wilson 15 By\nGRAEME BRYCE VINTAGE Jamie Vardy magic left Leicester third in the table and\nunbeaten ahead of the international break.\n\nHe grabbed a double as the Foxes underlined their credentials as serious\ncontenders to break up the top six this season.\n\nBrendan Rodgers' side have won two and drawn two of their opening four games and\nthe elated boss gathered his players near the centre circle for a celebratory\nhuddle.\n\nBournemouth, meanwhile, were left in a muddle.\n\nThey dropped down to 15th as their defence imploded with a performance so\nalarming that it will raise questions as to why midweek England call-up Tyrone\nMings was allowed to leave for Aston Villa during the summer.\n\nAt both ends of the park some of the defending bordered on farcical, if you were\nbeing kind.\n\nTake Leicester's opener after 12 minutes. If there is one thing everyone knows\nabout the Foxes it is that they have a useful striker. Name of Vardy  you may\nhave heard of him.\n\nLegend has it he is so quick he can switch off his bedroom light and be tucked\nup under the covers before it's dark.\n\nNow fast forward to match day when he pumps himself up by swigging down a\nminimum three cans of a well-known energy drink. Suddenly he is a whippet  with\nwings!\n\nSo how could Bournemouth's dozy defenders fail to fathom it was a bad idea to\nleave Vardy acres of space to run into behind them? Come to think of it, why did\nChris Mepham and Steve Cook fail to cut out the danger at source when they\nwatched Ben Chilwell's hoofed pass travel fully 50 yards towards them? Somehow,\nneither thought to apply the simple header required to defend their line and\nsuddenly Vardy was off haring past them.\n\nNaturally, he arrived at the ball first. One bounce off the turf and then a\nsublime lob with the outside of his right boot sent it sailing over Aaron\nRamsdale's head from 25 yards and into the corner of the net.\n\nHowever, three minutes later Leicester were at it as they gifted the Cherries a\nspeedy equaliser.\n\nAdam Smith found Harry Wilson with a throw and the winger moved the ball on to\nRyan Fraser.\n\nThe Scotland international ran at Ricardo Pereira, looked up and threaded a cute\nball behind Jonny Evans to Callum Wilson.\n\nCaglar Soyuncu watched it happen  but somehow did not think to match the\nstriker's bread-and-butter run into the channel.\n\nAnd that gave him the space he needed to dink the ball beyond Kasper Schmeichel\nand in off the post for his first goal of the season.\n\nLeicester responded as James Maddison flashed a header just wide from a Marc\nAlbrighton cross, before Soyuncu almost made amends for his howler by curling a\nshot just over.\n\nAnd the Foxes retook the lead just before half-time.\n\nYou guessed it, the Cherries' defence was caught napping when Vardy turned\nprovider, brushing past a powder-puff challenge from Cook to roll the ball\nacross the face of goal.\n\nYouri Tielemans nipped in to flick it home off the inside of the far post.\n\nAfter the break, VAR roared into action when Belgium midfielder Tielemans was\nguilty of a horrific challenge on Callum Wilson, which saw him rake his studs\ndown the striker's ankle.\n\nIn fairness to Tielemans he had looked to be protecting the ball  and VAR\nagreed that it was not a malicious challenge  although he was still a lucky boy\nto stay on the park.\n\nIronically, he could not even be yellow-carded, as VAR can only check for\nred-card offences.\n\nCallum Wilson's day was going from the sublime to the ridiculous and he was\nbooked for a dive in the box before Leicester put the game beyond his team with\na third.\n\nMaddison tried a clever stepover in the box to set up Vardy  but Mepham read\nthe danger and intercepted.\n\nIn keeping with the day, though, he then dallied and Maddison poked the ball\naway from his toes to Tielemans, who slipped a pass to Vardy on his left.\n\nAnd te hitman, 32, applied the finish, drilling the ball home from close range.\n\nJob done and Bournemouth undone.\n\nHow boss Eddie Howe must surely now regret selling Mings to Villa.",

I am not sure I am a big lover of it.\"\n\nWinless Watford remain rock bottom  but are at least now off the mark.\n\nBoss Javi Gracia was under fire following six league losses in a row, three of\nwhich came at the end of last term.\n\nAnd the Spaniard had a good moan at officials at the end, but even he was not\ncertain if VAR got the call wrong.\n\nMATCH He said: \"Maybe when the ball is falling it touched his hand. But I didn't\nsee it.\"\n\nYou fear for Gracia's men in their next two games against Arsenal and City.\n\nNEWCASTLE 5/3.......Shots on/5................Blocked\n49%.............466..................6.....................2/0..........Yellow/Yet\nthey got off to the perfect start here when Tom Cleverley was given time to fire\noff a 25-yard shot. It was blocked by Paul Dummett before taking a ricochet off\nhis teammate Jamaal Lascelles.\n\nAnd the loose ball fell to Will Hughes to steer past Martin Dubravka for\nWatford's second-fastest Prem goal.\n\nMiguel Almiron should have levelled when Christian Kabasele misjudged Christian\nAtsu's cross. But the Paraguayan, who has still not scored since his January\narrival, failed to control the bouncing ball.\n\nToon fans were restless, with one fan shouting, 'Where are your tactics,\nBrucie?' Yet the hosts got their lucky equaliser four minutes before the break.\n\nEmil Krafth crossed and, after an aerial battle between Craig Dawson and Hayden,\nit fell to Schar to net.\n\nReplays showed Hayden handled but VAR, for some reason, did not rule it out.\n\nSchar could have had a second after half-time but headed off target from six\nyards before Almiron scuffed another glorious chance.\n\nStill, it was the visiting fans who were now getting impatient as they chanted\nfor Gracia to make a change.\n\nAnd when he did make one after 71 minutes he almost had instant Success, as sub\nIsaac Success went close with a header.\n\nSTATS WATFORD had two other efforts  Cleverley's shot that deflected wide off\nteam-mate Roberto Pereyra, who also tested Dubravka.\n\nWATFORD off target .......3/5 shots................5 POSSESSION............ .51%\nPasses..................496 CORNERS.....................5 red cards..........3/0\nToon sub Yoshinori Muto then raced clear but hit the side-netting.\n\nMATCH STATS NEWCASTLE WATFORD 5/3.......Shots on/off target .......3/5\n5................Blocked shots................5 49% .............

            "content_plain": "SOUTHAMPTON....1 Vestergaard 58 Man United.........1 James 10 By DAN KING IT is\nthe first day of autumn and Manchester United are out of the title race.\n\nNot that they were ever in it, of course.\n\nBut with seven points dropped in the first four games, the reality of the\nchallenge facing boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been laid bare while most of the\nconkers are still on the trees.\n\nIt does not really matter that United probably deserved to beat ten-man\nSouthampton.\n\nThey created plenty of chances to score after Kevin Danso's sending off 17\nminutes from time left Saints clinging on for a point.\n\nIn the end, though, United were just not good enough.\n\nThey failed to build on Daniel James' early goal, allowed the home side back\ninto the game before half-time and then conceded an equaliser to centrehalf\nJannik Vestergaard (left). A tactical switch which moved the infuriating Paul\nPogba into an advanced position, that he felt more worthy of his talents, might\nhave paid dividends on another day.\n\nUnited did not have much luck, but how much do you deserve when you are asking a\n17-year-old striker to save the day with eight minutes to go? Mason Greenwood\nmay go on to be a big player for United and his effort produced the best of a\nnumber of decent saves by home keeper Angus Gunn.\n\nBut Solskjaer's side overall look short on quality and ideas, as well as goals.\n\nThat 4-0 romp against Chelsea just three weekends ago feels like an awfully long\ntime ago. Offloading your two most senior strikers  RomLukaku and Alexis\nSanchez to InMilan  without signing a replacemmelu nter ment egy, uled already\nlooked an interesting strateeven before a thigh injury ruAnthony Martial out of\nthis game.\n\nnalatic, Not having a designated No 1 penty-taker was also proving problemawith\nspot-kicks missed in consecutgames.\n\ntive ving ning wed But one new United policy  givthe ball to £18million summer\nsignJames at every opportunity  showsigns of paying off early on.\n\nave e to with The Welshman, 21, seemed to hrescued a point for United at home\nCrystal Palace seven days earlier wan excellent late goal.\n\nsecmier That was not the case but his sond strike in 11 minutes of PremLeague\nfootball was another beauty. SOUTHAMPTON had pressed hard their attacking third\nbut were slow close James down when he collectedsimple pass from Scott\nMcTominay.\n\ny. in w to d a. how firr of He still had a bit to do, but hwell he did it,\ncutting inside and ing a fierce shot into the top corner Gunn's net after just\nten minutes. 'James, James will tear you apart again,' sang the away fans, which\nis quite a tribute.\n\nThe chant, to the tune of the Joy Division hit 'Love Will Tear Us Apart', is\nmost associated with United legend Ryan Giggs, the most decorated player in\nEnglish football history.\n\nJames will not win anywhere near as much however long he stays at Old Trafford,\nbut he is the main reason to be cheerful so far this season.\n\nMoments later the Southampton keeper easily gathered a tamer effort from the\nWales international.\n\nBut Gunn had to be alert to beat out a snapshot from James midway through the\nhalf.\n\nIn that spell James was very much the focal point, more so than England\ncentre-forward Marcus Rashford, but United's overall performance was also\npromising.\n\nThe energy level was mostly high and Solskjaer's side showed purpose and\nambition whenever they had the ball, looking dangerous from almost every attack.\nAt the other end, the visiting defence was rarely troubled after Sofiane Boufal\nhad sent an eighth-minute shot just wide of David De Gea's right-hand post.\n\nSouthampton huffed and puffed but United's wall, with ten men retreating behind\nthe ball when necessary, was made of brick.\n\nThe home team were missing the in-form Nathan Redmond through injury and without\nhim they seemed to lack the guile to find a way through or around it.\n\nUnited's only concern at that stage was how Pogba had seemed to start losing\ninterest, as well as possession, in the latter stages of the opening 45 minutes.\n\nA big part of the reason Southampton gained the upper hand was Pogba's\ncarelessness with the ball.\n\nSure enough, within ten minutes of the restart Che Adams had fluffed Saints'\nbest chance of the game.\n\nThey need not have worried, the equaliser soon arrived.\n\nDe Gea had just kept out a Danny Ings header from a James Ward-Prowse cross.\n\nBut the United keeper was helpless when Danso swung the ball back in and 6ft 6in\nVestergaard outjumped Victor Lindelof to nod home on 58 minutes.\n\nThe industrious Shane Long was then thrown on for his first league action of the\nseason as Saints looked to cause United more hassle.\n\nBut following a free-kick the Tipperary man conceded, Danso was shown a second\nyellow for a challenge on McTominay, giving United  with Jesse Lingard on and\nPogba pushed up  17 minutes to avert an early-season crisis.\n\nGunn saved from James and Rashford, Lingard went close and then Greenwood forced\nthe Saints No 1 into his best stop of the game.\n\nThe Saints survived four minutes of stoppage time pretty easily.\n\nAfter three wins in his last 13 Premier League games, how long will even\nfan-favourite Solskjaer last if things don't improve soon?",

            "content_plain": "Chelsea..........2 Abraham 19, 42 Sheff Utd.......2 Robinson 46; Zouma (og) 89\nBy ANDREW DILLON FRANK LAMPARD watched the youngest Chelsea team in Premier\nLeague history blow a two-goal lead at Stamford Bridge.\n\nAnd even worse, last night the baby-faced Blues would struggle to buy a beer in\na supermarket to drown their sorrows.\n\nA starting XI with an average age of 24 years and 158 days fell foul of the\nunder-25 rule in many ways.\n\nNot only would they need ID to get booze but they also look worryingly immature\nat times.\n\nThe team which trudged off the pitch at the final whistle included pint-sized\nmidfielder Billy Gilmour, 18, who even if he did have proof of age would\nstruggle to see over the counter.\n\nTwo goals from in-form Tammy Abraham gave them a cushion from which to go on and\nbuild a solid victory. Yet once Sheffield United pulled a goal back less than a\nminute into the second half, Chelsea crumbled.\n\nPerhaps it is because the team is so young hat the boys out there in blue have\nsuch short attention spans.\n\nBoss Lampard's bold policy of giving the kids a chance is to be applauded but it\ncame at a hefty price yesterday.\n\nHe was denied a first home win since taking over as boss in the summer.\n\nAnd for the second game in a row at home he has looked on as his rookies wobbled\nafter getting themselves in the driving seat.\n\nBizarrely it was two of the wiser heads who contributed to their downfall.\n\nSkipper Cesar Azpilicueta allowed himself to be mugged on the edge of his box as\nIreland pair Enda Stevens and scorer Callum Robinson combined to haul the Blades\nback into it.\n\nThen Kurt Zouma's outstretched boot scored the calamitous own goal which totally\ntransformed the mood.\n\nEven with Chelsea 2-1 up and clinging on, the punters were loving the\nelectricity in the air as a team of home-grown players were rocking and rolling\nin a game full of ebbs and flows.\n\nWhen Lampard brought on Gilmour  born in the same June week in 2001 that his\nmanager signed for Chelsea  for his debut alongside Michy Batshuayi, it looked\nlike another brave masterstroke.\n\nToday it looks like a huge blunder from a man who is himself a rookie in terms\nof management  this being only his second season as a coach.\n\nThe decision to drop Denmark star Andreas Christensen and replace him with\nFikayo Tomori was a surprise one.\n\nReplacing a 23-year-old with somebody two years younger was enough to nudge the\naverage age of the starting XI down to a record in the modern game.\n\nWithout a shot on target in the first half from the visitors, there was little\nTomori  who was on loan at Derby under Lampard last term  could do in order to\nimpress and stake a claim to keep his place.\n\nBut his clean sheet was gone just 50 seconds into the second half when the\nBlades hit back with a goal to remind everyone that Lampard's fledgling Chelsea\nare a long way from a polished team  and one Mick McCarthy would love to see\nrepeated at the Aviva Stadium against Switzerland this Thursday.\n\nTaking the return pass from his own throw on the left flank, Stevens drifted\nthrough the Chelsea defence, stopping en route to nutmeg Azpilicueta. Then from\nthe by-line he cut the ball back to where striker Robinson stood unopposed and\nhe proceeded to hook the ball into the corner of the net from eight yards out\nfor his first Prem goal.\n\nLampard must be concerned at the lack of mental strength to chuck away a game\nagainst a spirited team but one which should have been rolled over.\n\nAbraham grabbed the first goal on 19 minutes after it had been pawed clear by\nBlades keeper Dean Henderson.\n\nHis second was another example of his striking instincts, capitalising on a\nhorrendous mix-up between Jack O'Connell and George Baldock to fire in.\n\nHenderson made a great save to deny Abraham a hat-trick and Kepa Arrizabalaga\nsaved a longrange bullet from Ollie Norwood. But amid chaos in the Chelsea back\nfour, Zouma stumbled as he tried to defend a cross into the box and the\nFrenchman poked the ball into his own net.\n\nMATCH STATS CHELSEA SHEFF UTD 711 .............

Corners\n....................... 16...............Fouls 2/0.............Yellow/Yet it was\nnot all sweetness and light for the Hammers and manager Manuel Pellegrini was\nfar from impressed early on.\n\nThere was a real lack of intensity as his players allowed Norwich to dominate\npossession and establish a toe-hold on the game.\n\nTodd Cantwell was able to slalom through three half-hearted challenges during\none particularly slack passage of play.\n\nIn fact West Ham were so poor they were forced to resort to gamesmanship when\nYarmolenko was guilty of a shameful dive under Cantwell's challenge in the box.\n\nRef Paul Tierney failed to take any action, which allowed the winger to go down\neasily again RATINGS with barely any contact from fullback Max Aarons.\n\nBut Norwich were unable to take advantage of their early control and conceded\nthe initiative.\n\nFelipe Anderson's charge on goal demanded a heroic last-ditch challenge from\nZimmermann.\n\nBut that was to be the towering German's last meaningful contribution to the\ngame before being taken out by Haller's lunge, which again went unpunished by\nTierney.\n\nAnd Zimmermann was still feeling the effects of that challenge when Haller found\nspace in the penalty area to fire West Ham ahead from Arthur Masuaku's inviting\ncross.\n\nEven that breakthrough goal could not settle Hammers nerves and they were lucky\nnot to concede a 31st-minute equaliser following more unconvincing defending.\n\nSTAts ................... .484 passes..........417 shots .................. 2\n....................... 2 conceded...............10 red cards.............1/0\nUnfortunately for Norwich, Cantwell was millimetres too short to make a clean\nconnection with Aarons' cross and headed a glorious opportunity over from a yard\nout.\n\nAny thoughts of a second-half comeback were dismissed when Yarmolenko put the\ngame beyond doubt in the 56th minute.\n\nThe lively Ukrainian certainly did not look like someone still finding his way\nback after ten months on the sidelines with a torn Achilles.\n\nHe pounced on Cantwell's loose control to tee up Mark Noble and when the ball\ncame back to him off Ben Godfrey, he smashed home beyond keeper Tim Krul's dive.\n\nDaniel Farke will be concerned at how quickly his Canaries players then allowed\ntheir heads to drop, with only Krul saving them from a real beating late on.\n\nMATCH STATS 470 ....................

            "content_plain": "IN the Drive For Five, Dublin have their very own Super 8. Eight players have\nstarted each of the All-Ireland finals Dublin have contested during this\nhistorymaking unbeaten run since 2015. Stephen Cluxton, Jonny Cooper, Philly\nMcMahon, James McCarthy, Cian O'Sullivan, Brian Fenton, Ciarán Kilkenny and Dean\nRock all started the finals in 2015, the 2016 drawn game, the 2016 replay, 2017\nand 2018.\n\nA total of 11 players have actually featured in each of those finals  with John\nSmall, Michael Fitzsimons and Kevin McManamon playing but coming off the bench\nin one or more.\n\nJim Gavin has used a total of 30 players across that quintet of deciders.\n\nAnd one of the strengths of this Dublin set-up has been the ability to\ncontinually bring through fresh talent and develop new leaders on the field to\nreplace those at the latter end of their careers.\n\nFormer Dublin captain Paul Griffin said: \"You are looking at five in a row.\n\n\"But there has been such a wellmanaged turnover over the five years.\n\n\"So there is a core group you are looking at that are potentially going for\ntheir seventh medal, they have been there for them all.\n\n\"But there's a lot of them for which this is maybe only their second or third.\n\n\"That makes it different for those guys in that they are not carrying the\nbaggage from previous years.\n\nThey are still coming out, attacking every medal like it's the first to go in\ntheir collection.\n\n\"It's not necessarily like it's the same group that has played all five so that\nprobably makes it slightly easier for them as a panel.\"\n\nFor example, this will only be Brian Howard's second All-Ireland final, having\nmade his senior breakthrough last year.\n\nIt is only Con O'Callaghan's third senior decider, the same for Niall Scully.\n\nEoin Murchan came from almost nowhere last year to become a Dublin regular.\n\nHe lined out in last year's final, but has started just one match this summer \nthe dead rubber against Tyrone in Omagh.\n\nIf Murchan is a defensive player who has lost out from last year, David Byrne is\none who has stepped back up.\n\nHe featured in the 2016 finals  starting the drawn game and being brought on as\na sub in the replay  but did not play in the 2017 or 2018 deciders.\n\nA broken bone in his foot hampered Byrne last summer and he did not even make\nthe match-day squad for the showpiece.\n\nBut during this year's campaign, he has played in all of Dublin's Championship\nmatches so far  starting in six of their seven encounters.\n\nOf the Super 8, McMahon and O'Sullivan were the only ones not named in\ntomorrow's starting XV, although Dublin's officially-named team is merely to be\nviewed as a guide, never to be taken as fact.\n\nBut whether there will be mass retirements should Dublin make history tomorrow\nremains to be seen.\n\nGriffin added: \"I don't know. It's difficult.\n\n\"If you are successful and you are winning, physically then it gets harder to\nstep away.\n\n\"They have got lives outside of football, career-wise, family-wise, a lot of\nthings will crop up.\n\n\"I think a lot of them, they take that time over the winter to have those\nconversations.\n\n\"Jim has always given them space to see what they want to do.\n\nIt will be hard for them all.\n\n\"The five, because it's the first time it will have been done, it's a potential\ncapstone  you'll have absolutely made history.\n\n\"They've been the best team from a Dublin perspective, hands down, but they do\nbecome very much the top of that conversation of what is the best team ever,\nbased on what they've done.\n\n\"Do fellas have the same drive and bite to get back again? \"Hopefully that's a\nconversation they'll be looking to have off the back of another All-Ireland.\"",

            "content_plain": "SEÁN O'SHEA left Croke Park in tears after his first All-Ireland final.\n\nHe was only four and father Seán Sr had to carry him out of the Cusack Stand\nafter Armagh defeated his beloved Kerry 1-12 to 0-14.\n\nThe deadly free-taker does not remember much about the day when Oisín\nMcConville's goal helped seal a historic first-ever title for the Orchard.\n\nBut he hopes the memories of today's decider against Dublin are both happy and\nplentiful  and that any crying after his first senior All-Ireland final as a\nplayer will mean there have been tears of joy.\n\nO'Shea, 21, said: \"As a young fella supporting Kerry, you go up to the game with\nyour family and you dream of playing.\n\n\"The first final I was at was 2002 against Armagh. I don't remember much about\nit because I was very young, but I was in the Cusack Stand with my parents.\n\n\"My only recollection is leaving the pitch and my father had to carry me out\nbecause I was in tears. I was only four.\n\n\"He coached me all the way up from Under-6 and I got most of the interest from\nhim.\"\n\nAt such a young age, football already meant so much to the younger Seán.\n\nFast-forward four years and the memories were a lot happier. Kerry eased past\nMayo 4-15 to 3-5 with goals from serial winners Declan O'Sullivan, Kieran\nDonaghy, Colm Cooper and Eoin Brosnan.\n\nToday, O'Shea will be one of the men that four- and eight-year-old Kerry lads\nwill be looking at in awe and in hope  and whether they pretend to be Seán\nO'Shea in their back gardens or not, he hopes they do not go away sobbing.\n\nHe added: \"My next final was in 2006 against Mayo  that's the first one I\nproperly remember. I would have looked up to a lot of them.\n\n\"I was a big fan of Declan O'Sullivan always, the way he played and took to the\nfield. He had everything.\n\n\"He was one of the key men for that team, the way he carried himself around the\npitch and with the stuff he did when he got the ball. He was a real leader.\n\n\"Watching the 'Gooch' as well, you'd want to emulate them in the back garden\nafter watching them play.\"\n\nO'Shea progressed well after he mimicked those legends back home in Kenmare. He\nwon minor All-Ireland crowns in 2015 and 2016 before making his senior\nChampionship debut last summer.\n\nHe only turned 21 in mid-July this year but his calmness on the ball and\ncomposure from frees make him look like he has been on the senior team for\nyears.\n\nThis summer he is Peter Keane's top scorer with 1-38, including 27 frees and two\n45s  a serious return for any young player in his second senior season.\n\nBut practice makes perfect. He explained: \"Since playing Under-12 and Under-14,\nI remember taking them, it comes naturally enough.\n\n\"Especially when I was younger, 15 or 16, when things weren't as busy and\ntraining wasn't as tough. I probably had a lot more time to go to the pitch with\nmy friends and bring a bag of balls.\n\n\"We might stay there two or three hours practising. It's all about the amount of\npractice.\n\n\"You just can't go out on the day and hope that things go well for you. What you\nput into it is what you get out of it.\n\n\"You never get a kick in a game that you haven't taken in training and that's\nwhere the confidence comes from.\"\n\nO'Shea has never before faced Dublin in Championship football.\n\nAs Jim Gavin's Sky Blues go for the five in a row, the bulk of the Kerry squad\njust want their first All-Ireland medal  but for O'Shea it is just a one-off\ngame.\n\nHistory might be on the line for the opposition, who are overwhelming\nfavourites, but then the history books show that no county has won Sam Maguire\nmore times than Kerry's 37  and if they make it 38 today, it will be one of\ntheir greatest feats.\n\nO'Shea added: \"Once you start playing football that's what you dream of. We know\nthe size of the challenge that is ahead of us.\n\n\"The main thing for us is the game, it is a one-off game. It's not history for\nus. We know the traditions that are in Kerry about winning All-Irelands and\nstuff.\n\n\"Dublin are the team going for five in a row. We just want to go up and do our\nbest and hopefully win one All-Ireland because a lot of our fellas wouldn't have\none.\n\n\"They are a fantastic team. They have won four All-Irelands in a row and there\nis a reason for that. They've been the best team in the country for the last\ngood while.\n\n\"There is a massive challenge ahead and we know we have to be on top of our\ngame.\n\n\"But we will go up and give it a rattle and hopefully that will be enough for\nus.\"\n\nKERRY have made one change from their semi-final victory over Tyrone with Gavin\nWhite replacing Shane Enright in the half-forward line.\n\nThere is no room for Tommy Walsh despite his impressive outing off the bench\nagainst the Red Hands.\n\n1 SHANE RYAN CLUB...................................Rathmore\nAGE...................................................23 HEIGHT\n.................................... 6ft 4in WEIGHT ...........................\n14st 11lb CHAMPIONSHIP DEBUT ..... 2019 JASON FOLEY\nCLUB...................................Rathmore\nAGE...................................................21 HEIGHT\n.................................... 6ft 1in\nWEIGHT..............................13st 3lb CHAMPIONSHIP DEBUT ..... 2018 3\nTADHG MORLEY CLUB ................................

            "content_plain": "JONNY COOPER found himself on the B team at Dublin training earlier this summer\n chasing around after Con O'Callaghan and Paul Mannion.\n\nBut more than anything, he was chasing down a jersey which had been pretty much\nhis own throughout this glorious unbeaten era for Dublin's footballers.\n\nPrior to this summer, Cooper had missed just two Championship games in the last\nfour years.\n\nThe first was the 2017 Leinster final against Kildare.\n\nAnd the second was the deadrubber Super 8s outing against Roscommon in 2018 \nwhen manager Jim Gavin made wholesale changes to his team.\n\nApart from those matches, Cooper started every match in Dublin's four-in-row\nsuccess.\n\nBut this summer he has missed three games  a niggling foot problem ruling the\nNa Fianna defender out for the entire Leinster SFC campaign.\n\nOver a matter of just a few weeks Cooper missed more Championship matches than\nhe had over the previous four years.\n\nHe recalled: \"You have to have patience but at the same time you're losing time\nvery quickly, very rapidly, particularly as selections go on.\n\n\"I stayed smart and just hoped the lads would keep winning games and that I'd\nget an opportunity to get back in the squad.\n\n\"I don't know how many weeks it was, six or eight weeks, maybe more, so that was\na long period of time, particularly at that part of the season.\n\n\"If it was earlier in the season I could have maybe got away with building up\nmore slowly.\"\n\nCooper, 29, featured prominently for Dublin throughout the league  starting\ntheir first six games but not featuring in their last outing against Cavan, also\na dead-rubber clash for which Gavin made numerous changes.\n\nBut by the time the Leinster SFC started, Cooper's name was off the team-sheet.\n\nAs Dublin breezed to their ninth straight Delaney Cup, he was in the shadows\ngetting himself right and preparing for the battle to get back in the frame for\na starting spot in the All-Ireland series.\n\nCooper said: \"You just start from the bottom and just try to claw your way back.\n\n\"Obviously I was doing stuff when the lads were training, on and off the pitch,\njust trying to maintain some level of ball work and skills, as much as I could.\n\n\"But yeah, on the training field, in terms of marking and spatial awareness and\nthat stuff, I was just trying to tick those boxes along the way.\"\n\nAnd so during the internal training matches, Cooper found himself on the B team.\n\nHe added: \"I think you get what you deserve. I didn't deserve in this case to be\non the first team.\n\n\"You're a competitor and you have to manage your individual emotions and\nexpectations.\n\n\"Also then you have 14 guys beside you who maybe feel similar but you have to\nget that performance for that team to win, but also put your own best foot\nforward.\n\nSo it's a tricky one in terms of trying to funnel your own energy into the team\nas opposed to yourself.\n\n\"Jim Gavin will spot that as well, if you're selfish around things and a little\nbit tunnel-visioned.\n\n\"But it's a good learning, I definitely found a lot of learning in it in terms\nof coming at it from a different angle or perspective.\n\n\"It was different. But I really enjoyed it in a strange way as well, it brought\nme back to around the time of Pat Gilroy, in my head.\n\n\"I've said it many times, that gave me a real good value in terms of trying to\nget on the team and what I thought it would be like.\n\n\"In a strange way it was kind of like that again, trying to prove myself to\nmyself and hopefully the management then pick me.\n\n\"In a strange way I think I got a lot from it as well.\n\n\"And you realise that things could have went the other way for me as well and I\ncould have been sitting on the bench or not even on the squad.\"\n\nHe was back in the match-day squad for Dublin's Super 8s opener against Cork.\n\nAnd in the 67th minute he was introduced off the bench for his first appearance\nof the summer, replacing fellow stalwart Cian O'Sullivan.\n\nCooper has started every game since  including the nothing match against\nTyrone.\n\nHe said: \"It's just trying to get the balance of not doing too much but also\nobviously playing as much as I could, getting 40-odd minutes in Omagh.\n\n\"And then some of the Super 8s gave me some of the stuff in the legs, to get up\nto that level.\"\n\nThat level, he reckons, will go up a few notches today when Kerry, who beat them\nin Tralee in the NFL this tear, stand as the last bump in the road to Dublin\ncompleting their Drive for Five.\n\nHe said: \"Obviously we played them in the league earlier in the year but apart\nfrom that we haven't come across them too much this year. They have a lot of\nvery talented players.\"\n\nAnd he expects, as a defender, to be given his toughest challenge of the year by\nthe Kerry forwards.\n\nCooper added: \"That's the beauty of it, it's cutting edge, you're walking a\ntight-rope and there's no real safety net.\n\n\"As nice as it to win a game by 10 points or whatever it is, it's also really\nnice  I find anyway  to be right on the edge of something, be right up against\na person who has a left and a right, who runs left and right and backwards and\ncan go high or low, and you're really facing that full array skill-set.\n\nay of their any ve r It's t you an av a nt -important \"It can go against\nobviously, but work that you have done for the year up to this point can come to\nfruition in terms of trying to stay on top or block a player or a run or\nwhatever.\n\nbut either you o \"So I am really looking forward to the challenge.\n\nup on Monday a in duals \"It is obviously massive challenge terms of the\nindividuals but also the collective the way they play.\n\nvi ct tive and \"They do share the load in terms of their scorers and their\nthreat, it can come from deep or from around the field.\"\n\nBut at this stage of his career  Cooper made his Championship debut in 2013 \nhe says he is able to take a wider view on the significance of today's\nAll-Ireland final. Cooper said: \"My journey, at the very, very beginning I\nwasn't on the team for a few years so that's sort of built into what way I think\nabout what I have, and the opportunities tunities I have.\n\n\"But also in te happen fo pla a erm or s terms of if it doesn't for me or if I\ndon't as much as I want, there's something else going to be there for me.\n\nplay then els th n sh e he sw way \"I can go and study for a few weeks or meet\nsome people from different sports or do something I'm interested in.\n\nwake o I the Io \"I'd like to think have a really good appreciation what I have.\n\nI go for \"An oow ndth to n will be as opposed t And hopefully that there all the\ntime being fickle or short-lived and based on whether I win or lose or draw, or\nwhatever.\n\n\"It's a serious game, but it's a game. It's important to me but either way you\nwake up on the Monday and do something that day.\"\n\nJIM GAVIN has named the same side that started the All-Ireland semi-final win\nover Mayo.\n\nBarring a late change, Cian O'Sullivan  who has started in each of Dublin's\nlast six All-Ireland finals  will be on the bench.\n\nCLUB ......................................

            "content_plain": "IT used to drive us mad.\n\nWhenever we played Kerry, you'd have the players from the 70s rolled out talking\nabout the great rivalry between the two counties.\n\nWaxing lyrically about the special relationship that existed between Dublin and\nKerry.\n\nBut actually it wasn't a special relationship.\n\nIn our dressing room it felt like a one-way relationship.\n\nYeah, there was give and take all right. They'd give us a beating and we'd take\nit.\n\nIn late November 1999, early in my Dublin career, we played Kerry in a league\ngame at Parnell Park, running out narrow winners, 1-8 to 0-9. And while the\ngames between us after that were always generally close enough, we never beat\nthem again. They always seemed to find a way.\n\nIn Championship, Dublin went between 1977 and 2011 without beating Kerry.\n\nBut since Dublin broke the spell in 2011, it is Kerry now who are on the\nreceiving end of this special relationship.\n\nThe Kingdom haven't beaten Dublin in the Championship since 2009. I've been\nthinking a lot about '09 this week.\n\nBecause when I read and hear former Kingdom players coming out with lines about\nKerry 'having a free shot, that there's no expectancy on them, that all of the\npressure is on Dublin', well, call me sceptical.\n\nI have the scars on my back from Kerry ambushes.\n\nYou see, 2009 was meant to be our time to turn the tables.\n\nBecause of injury, I had been forced to retire earlier that year but Pat Gilroy\nhad asked me to remain part of the backroom set-up.\n\nIn the build-up to our quarter-final against Kerry, I remember being in the\nmanager's room, as we called it, with Pat and Mickey Whelan going through the\nscouts' report on their march through e back door. Only they hadn't much marched\nas stumbled. Having lost to Cork by eight ints in a Munster semi-final play,\nKerry then put together nconvincing wins over Longrd, Sligo and Antrim. The\nreport was damning. nd it was the truth  they'd en terrible in all their games.\nThat was the summer Tomás Ó Sé and Colm Cooper got opped during the qualifiers r\ngoing drinking.\n\nthe so H po rep un forT An beeT Ó dro forK the wa woM the we the tea Kerry\nseemed to be all over e place, and the end verdict as that a good club team ould\nprobably beat them. Many of Kerry's heroes of e early and mid-noughties ere\nstill hanging on. But eir legs were gone and the am was on borrowed time.\n\nSo it was our time to finally put one over on them.\n\nOur assessment to the players wouldn't have been quite as blunt. We'd have\nwatered it down somewhat to ensure there'd be no complacency.\n\nBut on that day, it was us who were blown away. While the Dublin players looked\nrooted to the spot, Kerry  the team whose legs had gone  were full of running.\n\nI was maor foirne and in the first 20 minutes I was constantly on giving\ninstructions and switches to the players. It felt like I was doing more running\nthan them. We were trying to put out fires everywhere. At one point I looked up,\nsaw the scoreboard and said to myself, 'I'm wasting my time here, the game is\nover'. Afterwards, Pat used the phrase 'startled earwigs' to describe Dublin's\nperformance.\n\nWe'd been on the end of a Kerry ambush.\n\nSo 2009 has been on my mind a lot this week as the talk in the build-up to\ntoday's game has leaned strongly on how it's Dublin's to lose. That Kerry aren't\nready.\n\nThe first thing that should be said is that this will be the best set of\nforwards Dublin have come up against in the last four of five years  better\nthan anything Mayo or Tyrone have brought.\n\nBut when you delve through the stats, there are some red flags for Kerry \nparticularly their lack of green flags. Kerry have averaged one goal per game \nonly once have they actually managed to score two in any Championship match this\nsummer, against Meath.\n\nThey'll need at least two and probably three if they're to beat Dublin because\nthe figures show you'll almost certainly need to hit over 20 points to overcome\nthe champions.\n\nIt has to be a concern for Kerry that they only managed one goal against teams\nlike Clare and Cork, who aren't exactly defensively rock-solid.\n\nKerry also only scored one goal against Mayo. They owned the ball in that game\nand were completely dominant.\n\nDublin have been averaging two goals per game  they hit Cork for five and last\ntime out netted three against Mayo.\n\nThen you look at the damage Cathal McShane and Mattie Donnelly were able to do\nagainst the Kerry defence.\n\nThe sweeper role with Paul Murphy didn't work and defensively they just didn't\nseem on the same page.\n\nIf Kerry give Dublin the kind of space they afforded Tyrone then the Dubs will\ndestroy them.\n\nThe big hope for Kerry will be that David Clifford continues his incredible\nseason where everything he does ends up as a score.\n\nIt reminds me of Bernard Brogan in 2010  a season when nearly everything he\ntouched turned to gold.\n\nNo matter who Dublin put on him, I think they just need to accept Clifford is\ngoing to do some damage today.\n\nThe way his team-mates run into the scoring zone and then give a short hand-pass\nto him almost makes it impossible to defend against.\n\nSo I wouldn't be surprised if Dublin haven't spent a huge amount of time\nconcentrating on Clifford, but rather accept he'll do damage and instead give a\nlot of attention to stopping those around him and cutting off the supply further\nout the field.\n\nTommy Walsh is a possible x-factor for Kerry but you'd imagine Dublin have been\npreparing for that scenario too.\n\nWhich brings us back to the feeling in Kerry that this is a 'free shot' for this\ngroup.\n\nThe suggestion is that because it's largely a young squad trying to find their\nfeet at senior level after minor success, their day will come eventually  so\nthis one can be used as a learning experience. That all sounds a bit arrogant as\nwell.\n\nJust because you win so many All-Irelands at minor level doesn't mean the\nplayers will automatically convert that into senior All-Irelands over the next\ndecade. You take your chances when you can. The Dublin dressing room is not\nexactly an old folks' home.\n\nBrian Howard is 22, Con O'Callaghan 23, Jack McCaffrey 25 and Paul Mannion,\nBrian Fenton and Ciarán Kilkenny are all just 26.\n\nI remember talking to Henry Shefflin about Kilkenny's Drive for Five coming up\nshort.\n\nHe said the difference he sees is that many players in that dressing room knew\nthey were coming to the end of the road. They were trying to win one more before\nfinishing up.\n\nBut Dublin's age profile doesn't indicate this is a team reaching the end of the\nline. Some might go but now a new core group of leaders have already taken over\nthe mantle of their key men.\n\nThey all have many years left ahead of them. And crucially, they know what it\ntakes to win All-Irelands and to beat Kerry.",

He said: \"These evil\nand I told everyone happen  they are in of killing people.\n\npeople are pure ryone this would n the business one of lfriend, son's mbed e \nng r--ertss ht ud said \"They have killed my sons and his girlfriend, dug up my\nother grave and pipe-bombed my daughter's home  so this latest killing\nshouldn't be a surprise to anyone. \"Maguire's associates will also be looking\nover their shoulders and I don't see an end to this feud until Maguire's gang\nare brought to justice.\n\n\"Once the feud started last year I matsomethere's the last.\n\nit would only be a matter of time before someone was killed and there's no doubt\nit won't be \"My hope is that get on top of them their every move to killing more\npeople.\"\n\nthe Gardai m and watch stop them from Ana's suspected One of Willie and killers\n who has also been linked to digging up the grave of Joe's other son Michael in\nAugust 2016  has dyed his hair and is now in hiding over fears Maguire's\nenemies are plotting to whack him.\n\nJoe also told how he would continue with his own fight for justice. He added:\n\"Even though they've tried to silence me they won't stop me. The only person who\nwill stop me fighting for justice is God. We won't stop fighting to find Joe and\nAna.\n\n\"We just want them back so we can give them the Christian burial they deserve.\nOur lives have been torn apart for over four years now and we just want to know\nwhere they are. I would hate for other innocent fili t th h h t h families to go\nthrough what we have experienced these last number of years. They have destroyed\nso many lives and they need to be stopped.\n\n\"They won't intimidate me even though they had guns and they won't keep me\nsilent. They are using young people for their dirty work and what good is this\nmoney to them if they're in jail or dead?\" Following Branigan's killing last\nweek, there are now fears his associates will hit back in a revenge attack.\nAlthough Branigan, 29, had a lengthy criminal record including nine convictions\nfor violent disorder he wasn't seen as a major gangland figure or actively\ninvolved in the Drogheda feud over the past year. At present, Gardai believe\nbetween 12 and 15 members from each rival faction in the Drogheda feud are\nliving under an active death threat although Branigan wasn't under any type of\nthreat when he was killed.\n\nAnd as officers brace themselves for more violence, the Armed Support Unit and\narmed detectives have stepped up patrols to prevent further attacks under\n'Operation Stratus'.\n\nA source said: \"The key players in this feud have been identified and if spotted\non the streets they will be stopped and searched. Gardai can't be everywhere but\nare employing all the resources available to prevent ng their lives.\"\n\nW tt h more people from losing \" Superintendent Andrew Watters, who is running\nthe probe into the hit, called it a \"particularly indiscriminate and callous\nact\" and said it was \"very traumatic\" for residents.\n\nHe added: \"There was a lot of families, women with young children, close to the\narea of the shooting.\n\n\"The investigation is at a very early stage. A number of lines of investigation\nare ongoing. We have an operation in place in the Drogheda District to deal with\nserious organised crime and in that regard, I would like to reassure the people\nof Drogheda and the surrounding areas.\n\n\"We have made a number of significant detections, arrests, prosecutions. We have\npeople before the courts on very serious charges t it b il diti on very strict\nbail conditions, and just like to reassure the public the operation is ongoing.\"\n\n\" The feud erupted in July 2018Maguire cheated death. Gardai it started when\nyoung men for Maguire's associates drug money turned against him.\n\nSince then, there have been over incidents including three attempted murders, a\ncrude car bomb left residential area, pipe bombings, arson attacks, kidnappings,\nand assaults.\n\nSinn Fein TD Imelda Munster called for 'round the clock' of the mobsters\ninvolved in feud. She said: \"It is clear thugs don't care who they put risk.\nWhat has happened has sent h k th h th l k it shock waves through the close-knit\ncommunity in the village. It is natural that people are anxious that those\nresponsible are arrested and brought before the courts.\n\n\"People in Drogheda are of the belief this feud is nowhere near over and won't\nbe until the instigators are arrested and charged. Frustration has set in with\nthe local community who feel these culprits appear to act without fear of being\ncaught.\n\n\"I have repeatedly called for round-the-clock surveillance and I reiterate this\ncall again. It appears that is the only way to monitor their every move, curtail\ntheir drug dealing and to prevent further attacks and shootings.\" @SteBreen",

The plan prompted an angry backlash from MPs and\nno-deal Brexit opponents.\n\nes Protesters gathered yesterday outside Oxford University's Balliol College,\nwhich was attended by Mr Johnson, to express their displeasure at his handling\nof Brexit.\n\nUCaJt hBSr ada Meanwhile, Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott addressed the\nLondon protesters from a stage near Downing Street.\n\nin She told the crowds: \"We cannot allow Boris Johnson shutdown Parliament cato\nBirmingham li and to shutdown the voice of ordinary British people.\"\n\nIn a stinging attack on the PM outside Downing Street, Labour shadow chancellor\nJohn McDonnell labelled Boris a \"dictator\" for his \"very British coup\" plan.\n\nAddressing the crowd, he said: \"We have defeated dictators in the past in our\nhistory and we will defeat this dictator under Johnson.\"\n\nWestminster Bridge was blocked by protesters, who were shouting: \"If you shut\ndown our Parliament, we shut down your bridge.\"\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said that three people have been arrested at the\ndemonstration in London. Among them was London Assembly member Caroline Russell,\naccording to a spokeswoman for the UK Green Party.\n\nFootage posted on social media appeared to show the politician being led away\nfrom the crowds in handcuffs after she had been sitting and blocking the road.\n\nSpeaking at a demo in her Brighton constituency, former Green Party leader\nCaroline Lucas thanked those who turned out, adding: \"This is what democracy\nlooks like.\"\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Chancellor Sajid Javid defended the\nprime minister's decision to suspend Parliament.\n\nHe said: \"It's quite usual this time of year for Parliament to go in to a\nrecess. It's perfectly correct and appropriate to prorogue Parliament. \"I think\nit's absolutely right that this prime minister and his government get the chance\nto set up their agenda.\"\n\nHe added: \"I am very comfortable with the approach that we've taken because I\nthink it is absolutely right that this prime minister and his government gets an\nopportunity to set up their agenda. \"And when we think about the role of\nParliament, it is right that our Parliament gets to hear that agenda and then\nalso gets to vote on it.\"",

            "content_plain": "LAST month, we featured the story of Ann Walsh, whose ex murdered her 14 years\nago.\n\nAnn's brother Stephen spoke out after learning killer Raymond Donovan, left, was\nup for parole for the third time since 2006.\n\nftt This is despite being sentenced to mandatory life. He called for those\nconvicted of murder to be denied the ability to apply for d parole until they\nhave served 20 years of their sentence.\n\nCurrently Irish law allows a killer to apply for parole after seven years of\ntheir sentence.\n\nThe Justice Department said: \"While prisoners serving life sentences are\ncurrently eligible for hearing after an initial parole h seven years, life\nsentence prisoners released on parole in recent years have, on average, served\nmore than 18 years in prison.\"\n\nThe new Parole Act 2019, passed by the Oireachtas in July, will stop lags given\nlife applying for parole until at least 12 years into their sentence. But is 12\nenough? Here we speak to two people with differing views.\n\n6It's an incentive to engage with services7 FIONA NI CHINNEIDE Irish Penal\nReform Trust LIFE should not mean life. In Of these, 13 had served 20-25 LIFE\nshould not mean life. In Ireland, a life sentence rarely means the person spends\nthe rest of their life in prison.\n\nThe majority will be released on license or 'parole' at some point. Being\ngranted parole does not mean a life sentence is over. The person can be returned\nto prison for a breach of parole conditions at any time for the rest of their\nlife.\n\nParole conditions can restrict where the person goes or lives, who they can\ncontact or associate with and most often requires the person to be of good\nbehaviour, sober habits and keep the peace. Parole also allows for supervision\nin the community by probation officers and the Gardai.\n\nParole's main purpose is public safety. It does this by providing structured,\nsupported and supervised transition of prisoners back into the community. It\nusually involves periods of temporary release, an important measure that\nsupports reintegration.\n\nParole also provides an incentive for prisoners to engage with services while in\njail, including programmes and treatment that address the grave crimes they\ncommitted. Incentives in prison are proven to make prisons safer for everyone,\nincluding staff.\n\nLaws passed in July mean people sentenced to life can't apply for parole until\nthey have served a minimum of 12 years.\n\nHowever, eligibility for review by the Parole Board is only the first step in a\nlong process towards release. In 2017, the average prison time served by lifers\nrecommended for release was 18 years. The time served by some prisoners was\nsignificantly longer.\n\nIn 2017, of the people serving life sentences, 34 had already served more than\n20 years.\n\nOf these, 13 had served 20-25 years, seven had served 25-30 years, 12 had served\n30-40 years and two had served over 40 years.\n\nHeadlines that suggest life-sentenced prisoners are released after seven or even\n12 years do not reflect reality, and may cause unnecessary distress.\n\nHowever, we do not agree with calls to introduce mandatory minimum periods.\nThere is no evidence mandatory sentencing either prevents or reduces crime.\n\nBut mandatory sentencing always results in unequal justice. No two cases are the\nsame and therefore, it is of critical importance that judges have the discretion\nto impose a sentence that is proportionate to the gravity of the crime.\n\nIn Ireland, convictions for murder attract a mandatory sentence of life. One\neffect of the mandatory nature of the sentence means there is no incentive for a\nguilty plea. This means victims' families and friends almost always have to\nendure a lengthy trial process.\n\nAnother effect is that there is no clarity around the length of time that a\nperson will serve as part of that sentence. IPRT is completely opposed to calls\nto introduce mandatory or presumptive minimum sentence lengths. However,\nlegislation that allows judges the discretion to set a minimum length of time\nthat must be served in prison, based on the particular circumstances of the\nindividual case, are worth considering.\n\n6Some believe murder should mean life in jail7 MARTIN CONWAY Senator FOURTEEN\nyears have now passed since Ann Walsh was murdered in the grounds of St Senan's\nChurch in Kilrush, Co Clare by Raymond Donovan.\n\nSt Senan's Church is a most beautiful sacred ground which has hosted many\nspecial events. It is also where Ann met her brutal death aged just 24.\n\nI vividly recall the days following this crime and the stunned reaction, not\njust in Kilrush and Clare, but right across Ireland.\n\nAt the time, I ran a store in the town and I experienced first-hand the effect\nAnn's murder had on the people of Kilrush and the surrounding area. What's\nsurprised me is how quickly 14 years have passed. It seems that this dreadful\ncrime was not that long ago. I am surprised the issue of parole is on the agenda\nalready and would share the family's concern with such a development. In the\nSeanad recently, we debated the issue of sentencing, particularly in relation to\nmurder and mandatory life sentences during the various stages of the Parole Bill\n2019. While this bill is a welcome development, there are provisions which did\nnot get universal agreement.\n\nPositive provisions include the establishment, for the first time in the State,\nof an independent statutory parole board and it sets out a clear and transparent\nprocess the board will have to follow. The Act specifically provides that parole\ncan only be granted if the prisoner does not pose an undue risk to the public.\n\nWhen the Act is commenced, a prisoner serving life will only become eligible for\nparole after a minimum of 12 years is served.\n\nThis caused the most debate in the Seanad at the time as many senators believed\nthis was too short. While I voted for the bill, I was one of those who did\nexpress reservations.\n\nMy reservations, like other members, was surrounding the provision which\nstipulated that a person serving a mandatory life sentence for murder would be\neligible for parole after serving 12 years. I simply felt that it was not\nacceptable to be eligible for parole and potentially released after just 12\nyears in prison.\n\nI absolutely accept it would be a very rare situation where a person would get\nparole immediately after serving 12 years but the fact it will be legally\npossible is a concern. On the other hand, we will have, for the first time, a\nparole board established on a statutory basis with very well defined criteria.\nThis will ensure much greater consistency and will bring us in line with\ninternational best practice.\n\nFor the loved ones of family members who have been murdered, it is a life\nsentence where life really is life and there are people in society who believe\nthat if you murder another human being that should mean life in prison. It is a\nposition that is hard to argue with.\n\nAs a society we have a duty to protect our citizens and like any other piece of\nlaw, the Parole Act can be amended if it is demonstrated its provisions are not\nworking in the best interest of all of the people of our country.",

He is such a loose cannon, that prison officers had\nto wear riot gear to interact with him.\n\nThe question people will ask is, how has he been allowed back into decent\nsociety? There will be no riot cops on hand to protect the public from him.\nGardai in particular will need to be on high alert. The warning issued to\nmembers of the force this week was stark.\n\nThe special directive urged them to \"assess all risk before engaging with Leon\nWright\" as he is \"extremely violent\" and \"does not react well to authority in\nany shape or form\".\n\nIt states officers should \"exercise extreme caution\" dealing with him. Warnings\nlike this are rare and show how seriously cops are taking his release.\n\nWright has severe mental health issues and is a clear danger to society.

I mean, I did it for 35 years.\nIt's a long time. And I always knew that it was coming to an end because I knew\nI'd be retiring at that stage. So it has been fine.\n\n\"It wasn't like it took me by surprise so when I stepped out of the role, I was\nready to step out.\"\n\nCommenting on his first campaign outside of the studio, he said: \"When you've\ndone something for so long, and then you're out of the loop, it puts a different\nperspective on it, you know, but yeah, it's all good.\n\n\"I've enjoyed the season. The football hasn't been particularly great, to be\nhonest with you. But the hurling was pretty good.\"\n\nAsked if the GAA needs a Kerry win to bring a stop to the negativity around\nDublin's domination, the Co Waterford born presenter responded: \"I suppose they\nprobably do.\n\n\"It's interesting that back in 1982, when Kerry were going for the five in a\nrow, there was a lot of rumbling then from the GAA writers about where football\nwas. So sometimes things don't change all that much.\n\n\"I think the problem with the championship at the moment is not Dublin's\ndominance, although that is a factor in it. But I think a bigger problem is the\nstandard of football.\n\n\"Let's face it, the standard in Leinster is poor. There is nobody to trouble\nDublin in Leinster and there hasn't been for the last five or six years. And\nuntil other counties step up to the mark the problem will persist.\"\n\nAsked what his own preferred outcome would be, he said: \"Whatever way the final\nworks out, whatever the result, it's going to be a major occasion one way or the\nother. \"It's either going to be Dublin achieving this milestone, or it's going\nto be the shock of Kerry depriving them of it, as they were themselves in 1982.\nSo there's a story in this no matter what way it plays out.\"\n\nThe veteran broadcaster has had a string of health issues over the last number\nof years, suffering heart failure in 2012, a mini stoke in 2013 and a\npotentially fatal cardiac arrest in 2015.\n\nBut Lyster said he couldn't rule out the possibility of getting in front of the\ncamera again, adding: \"We will play that one by ear and see how it works out.\"",

I can understand that, but now she's saying that I was a contractor\nbut I always thought I was an employee. I never had any contract at all so how\ncould I be a contractor? ATHIS is a tricky situation because without any\npaperwork at all you'd have to fight your case outside of work.\n\nIf it turns out you were a contractor there are things like taxes that you\nshould have paid. Equally if you had the hallmarks of an employee and fit the\n'employee test', you could be due severance pay.\n\nQMY insurance disc hasn't arrived, and I got pulled over by the Gardai and they\nsaid that I had to come to the station and produce it.\n\nTurns out it was lost in the post or something and I only got it a day after the\ndeadline. Now I'm worried I'll get in trouble for being late but I did\neverything I could to get it and I can prove I paid for it before my insurance\nwas up, what do you reckon? ATHE Gardai are usually a reasonable bunch. Show\nthem proof of payment from your card or account and the disc, I don't think a\nday late will matter that much.\n\nQI HAVE a house which has no mortgage on it and I want to buy another one but\nhave no money.\n\nThe frustrating thing is that the home I want next would be much cheaper but I\ncan't get a mortgage due to my age, is there anything I can do? AHAVE you\nthought about a 'sale and lease back'? This is where you sell a house then rent\nit back from the buyer for a certain amount of time.\n\nYou might need to leave money with a solicitor to hold and indemnify the deal\n(so that you stick to your side of it), along with a penalty clause, but it\nmight work in your situation.",

You could watch Love Island while making a\nmortgage application over your phone, and all the documents can be done at home\nso you aren't sending in paperwork or scanning things up and emailing them.\n\nThe advantage to this is that it's quicker, easier and will give people who use\nit the advantage of a total view of all prices so you can make a smart decision\nabout the best choice for you while ensuring there are no pesky salespeople\nhassling you about anything. The system does both mortgages and insurances like\nlife insurance (we don't do things like car insurance or house insurance yet).\nWe believe this will revolutionise the mortgage market because in time it means\nyou'd be able to switch a loan far quicker, and in doing so, save money.\n\nThere might come a day where to do that all you have to do is scan your\nfingerprint. Obviously that type of financial technology is a long way away. We\nhaven't even done digital mortgages yet, but we plan to lead the way. Check it\nout on yes.ie.",

The three E's of wealth are\neducation, enduring marriage and end mortgage.\n\ndof get part, ducation of money directed towards Most of us the education nobody\nsays education is bad. Lots and policy is getting people more education  and\nit's something I regularly talk about in this column as a form of\nself-improvement and better business prospects.\n\nThe 'right' type of education also matters. For instance, some people might get\na degree in sociology or some niche area that has no real industrial value,\nthat's a quick way to spend a few years earning the right to be poor.\n\nSometimes it can strangely help. A retired teacher I know told me a builder he\nknows is great because he studied hotel management and it gave him a great\nattitude for the things that go wrong on sites and because of that his clients\nlove him.\n\nEnduring marriage is the next one. It's also not one that you'll ever hear Irish\nmammies and daddies promoting, even though it was a large contributor to many of\ntheir own successes. Brookings did an interesting paper on it recently called\n'The Marriage Divide'.\n\nThere are many reasons for why married couples do better financially even though\nhaving children and the like is very expensive. In the US, among poor Americans\nonly 26 per cent are married but 39 per cent of working class people are.\nMarriage in high income families is 56 per cent. About 60 per cent of poor\nAmericans are single.\n\nIt affects kids too. For every 100 born to unmarried parents, 64 of them are\npoor, while 13 are middle and upper class.\n\nIt's not politically correct to say it, but the large divergence in wealth\ninequality came about as people started getting divorced more often. In the US,\nit happened since the 70s.\n\nAnd no, that doesn't mean I'm saying people should stay in bad marriages. But\nyou equally can't tell me that a family spread across two cheap to run they are\nall one roof. Speaking of roofs, the last E End of mortgage.\n\nhomes is as c as when t under o Spea roofs is moT ab pe be fr ow This comes\nabout when a person becomes debt free and owns a large asset.\n\nassW buy and p over capital day becom theirs and that c h f When people a home\npay it down time, the value one becomes entirely constitutes a huge amount of\nwealth that renters simply never have access to nor do they generally save their\nway to an equivalent value either.\n\nOften I call a mortgage forced savings because it makes people make a payment\ntowards their wealth come rain, wind or snow. In times this becomes the primary\nwealth of people and in Ireland it's the same as in other countries. In fact, a\nHarvard study found that the biggest differentiator of wealth between black and\nwhite people wasn't education or opportunity, it was years of homeownership.\n\nSo when you want to do right by your kids, remember that education is only one\npart of it. Finding a good husband or wife, marrying them, getting a home and\npaying it off are the ingredients of financial success. I do have to mention\nmoney isn't everything though!",

Tellingly, the\nlast time one of her records featured on BGT was in May 2017  a month before\nthe Grenfell Tower fire.\n\nOn The X Factor, her songs  previously a staple of the show  have not featured\nsince the blaze.\n\nThe singer famously showed up to the tower block wreckage in West London 24\nhours after the tragedy.\n\nBut she refused to appear on Cowell's star-studded charity single, a re-working\nof Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water. Last night a source told\nthe Irish Sun on Sunday: \"Simon put his heart and soul into that recording, and\nused up a lot of favours getting so many big names to lend their voices and give\nup their time for free.\n\n\"He saw Adele down at Grenfell and assumed she'd leap at the chance to help\nraise more funds. Unfortunately negotiations came to a grinding halt, and she\ndeclined to take part.\n\n\"Understandably Simon was frustrated, and as a result currently refuses to play\nany of her songs on his shows.\n\n\"Say what you like about Simon, he's a genuine guy. If Adele wouldn't help him\nout, then he's not going to boost her album sales by playing her tracks.\n\n\"The stats speak for themselves  whilst pre-2017 Adele was a staple on The X\nFactor, her tunes haven't appeared post-Grenfell.\n\n\"Clearly Adele is no longer in vogue with Simon or his creative team.\"\n\nSongs penned by Adele used to be a popular choice among contestants on Cowell's\nshows.\n\nIn 2011 then-judge Louis Walsh tried to ban X Factor wannabes from singing Adele\ntracks at auditions because so many were doing them.\n\nPast winners James Arthur, 31, and Sam Bailey, 42, were among those to perform\nher songs.\n\nBut the last person to sing one was Ryan Lawrie in October 2016.\n\nAdele herself has not appeared on it since December 2015.\n\nIn May 2017, BGT hopeful Kyle Tomlinson belted out Rolling In The Deep  the\nlast time one of her songs has featured on the show.\n\nIndustry experts previously claimed Adele's chart success has been helped by The\nX Factor.\n\nStars including Robbie Williams, Liam Payne, Rita Ora, James Blunt and Stormzy\nall appeared on Cowell's single, released a week after the devastating fire\nkilled 72 people.\n\n@IrishSunOnline",

            "content_plain": "By FIONA ELLIS AUTHOR Dervla McTiernan says the recession imploded her life \nbut at the same time set her free.\n\nThe best-selling author has had her debut novel The Ruin developed for the big\nscreen by Colin Farrell as his first Chapel Place production.\n\nAnd she couldn't be more thrilled and excited.\n\nBut less than a decade ago the former lawyer was left reeling after the\nrecession devastated her financially.\n\nDervla and her family packed up and left for Australia to start a new life in\n2011. But now the author of The Ruin, The Scholar and The Good Turn reckons that\nawful period in time was a gift.\n\nShe said: \"I was a solicitor in Galway and had a small practice there and my\nhusband Kenny was a civil engineer. The recession decimated my practice and it\nhit Kenny's work very badly as well.\n\n\"We were faced with starting again, and building everything from the bottom up,\nand we looked at each other and we just said: 'Ah, I don't want to do it again.'\n\"We had just spent the last six years working every hour and we just wanted a\nfresh start so we came to Perth.\n\n\"We didn't know a sinner.\n\nWhen I look back on it, it was madness, and I was expecting a baby at the time\nas well.\"\n\nIt was out of character for the then 34-year-old to make such a move.\n\nShe explained: \"I am a little impulsive, but we'd always been incredibly\nresponsible both Kenny and I. We area little conservative and certainly very\nresponsible people. \"But it didn't work out for us. We bought our house at the\nwrong time, we were really hammered. It was absolutely brutal and it took us\nyears to recover and pick ourselves back up off the floor. \"We lost ten years of\nsavings. We started from scratch and we were over here trying to raise a baby\nand a twoyear-old with no family and no support  it was tough.\n\n\"But if you were to ask us now we would both say it was a gift in the long run.\nIt set us free. It imploded the life we had, and set us free to go after what we\nwanted.\"\n\nDervla, mum to Freya and Oisin, only started following her true passion \nwriting  in 2014. She said: \"Books were always my passion, but I wasn't brave\nenough to try. I started writing seriously mid-2014. I made a decision that I\nwas really going to do it.\n\n\"I made this commitment to myself, I would give it five years and If I didn't\nget anywhere then we would see.\n\n\"I signed a contract with Harper Collins in October 2016 and The Ruin came out\nFebruary 2018.\"\n\nSometimes Dervla wonders what she might have achieved had she started writing\nearlier.\n\nShe said: \"Part of me wishes I started sooner now I am bursting with things I\nwant to do. There so many different types of things I want to try my hand at\nwithin this area and I have a finite amount of time because the kids are still\nyoung so I am always juggling.\n\n\"So part of me thinks, 'God, if I had my twenties and I really focused, what\ncould I have done?' \"But the other part of me thinks, 'I didn't have a voice in\nmy twenties', I didn't know who the hell I was or what I thought about.\n\n\"I think I needed to grow up and have a few hard things happen to me and come\nout the other side to find my voice.\"\n\n6We lost 10 years of our savings. We started from scratch and we were in Perth\ntrying to raise a baby and a two-year-old child with no family and no support 7",

Games like the upcoming Gears of War 5, the\ncritically-acclaimed Forza Horizon 4 and less-acclaimed Sea of Thieves have all\nbeen available through Game Pass on their release day.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before the service expanded beyond the confines of\nthe Xbox One console and the first destination is Windows 10 PCs.\n\nMany Xbox games are currently available on PC through the Play Anywhere service\nso it was an easy decision to make first-party Microsoft titles available too.\nSoccer spreadsheet Football Manager 2019 and the complete versions of Halo Wars\n1 and 2 are PC royalty for €4 a month. And with Gears 5 emerging on the service\non the September 10, that €1 trial price is practically unmissable.\n\nA small number of users have had issues installing certain games like Age of\nEmpires HD and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. A little search on the internet\nfor the error will fix it but it's still worth noting.\n\nThe selection isn't as strong as the Xbox Game Pass console version  there is a\ngreater number of filler titles and short indie experiences that don't add much\nvalue to the line-up. But it must be noted that it costs less than half of the\nconsole version per month.\n\nThe marquee titles are exceptional though. The aforementioned FM 2019, Halo\nWars, Age of Empires HD as well as upcoming Gears of War 5 and Age of Empires II\nHD offer enough immediate variety and quality to make it worth the price of a\nfew months on their own.\n\n*Or as part of Game Pass Ultimate (€12.99 per month)  Game Pass Ultimate offers\nboth Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass for both console and PC in one\nsubscription.",

The\nyoungster will have to wait until he is 16 to enter junior strongman contests,\nbut he's been lifting weights and practising poses since the age of nine. Gavin\nhelps dad Keith Maher run Silverback's Gym in Graiguecullen, Co Carlow, as an\nunofficial coach.\n\nKeith was Ireland's Strongest Man in 2014 and is currently in training to enter\nBritain's Strongest Man.\n\nBut while Gavin clearly inherited his strength from his dad, Keith said he\nwasn't the inspiration for his son to hit the weights.\n\nHe said: \"I never told him to pick up a weight. He didn't even go to the\ncontests when I was competing. This all started when he was nine, and he saw big\nlads of 16 in the gym, and he just jumped in.\n\n\"I'd look at him to see if he's doing it right, but he doesn't need my help now\n he's giving tips to adults. If anyone is doing a benchsquat wrong, he'll tell\nthem!\" Gavin started off powerlifting but is now focused on bodybuilding  the\nold-fashioned Charles Atlas way.\n\nHe trains with European Champ Vinnie Craine and is focused on getting a\ntraditional muscled physique. Keith said: \"He told me he doesn't want to be\nbulky with a big gut, he wants to go for the classic build. So he's not\nfollowing in my footsteps  he wants to do what Vinnie is doing.\"\n\nBut, unlike some of the older bodybuilders and powerlifters, Gavin is not on a\nstrict diet. Keith said: \"He would eat ice cream till it came out of his ears!\nHe's always asking me for money to go to Dunnes Stores to buy sweets ... On a\nFriday morning, we go for a treat, a rasher sandwich, and he loves it. He burns\noff all the calories in the gym.\n\n\"At a time when kids are told to do more physical activity, and there's so much\nobesity, it's good to see a young lad has a healthy lifestyle.\n\n\"I try to encourage other young people to get into the gym. We tell kids in the\nCarlow Youth Centre to come to our gym. Even if they don't have the money, they\nare welcome.\"\n\nGavin's sister, Kia, 17, is not interested in bodybuilding at all, their dad\nadds. \"She's more into fashion.\"\n\nBut being fit is not just about building muscle, their dad says  \"I'm just\nhappy they're active.\"\n\nWhen Gavin is not in the gym, he finds other ways to keep on the move. His dad\nsaid: \"He's not the kind to sit around. He has an X-box but he's never opened\nit! When he's not in the gym, he's out walking the dogs or looking after the\nchickens.\n\n\"He's also into rally cars. He wants to be a mechanic when he leaves school, but\nhe has the option to work with me in the gym. He could work as a fitness trainer\nbecause he knows how to talk to people.\"\n\nFamily friend, personal trainer and bodybuilder Nicoleta Chiorean, said: \"I\nthink Gavin is going to be a champion. He will be big!\"",

To say we are thrilled would be an understatement.\"\n\nIt was O'Rourke's third victory of the week in the Spanish capital.\n\nShe took out Ukraine's Tetiana Petrovich in the quarter-final and Anastasia\nShamonova of Russia in the semis.\n\nAnd she simply refused to lose against Wojcik, who resorted to holding tactics\nfrom the opening bell against her opponent's swarming attacks. Ireland's head\ncoach Zaur Antia said: \"Aoife was phenomenal. Brilliant performance and she's\nmade history for such a young woman. She has a great future ahead of her  the\nfuture is green.\"\n\nIrish featherweight champ Eric Donovan, who took gold at the 2010 Europeans in\nMoscow, reckons O'Rourke is looking good for next summer's Olympic Games.\n'Lilywhite Lightning' said: \"Congratulations to Aoife O'Rourke on becoming\nIreland's newest European boxing champion.\n\n\"What an incredible achievement. With the Tokyo Olympics just around the corner\nthis is very promising.\"\n\nTeam-mate Amy Broadhurst will take home a bronze medal from the tournament.\n\nHaving scooped six European medals in underage boxing, it was the Dundalk\nlightweight's first major medal as a senior boxer.\n\nThe team returns home this morning and test matches are expected in the next\nfortnight to help with the selection of the final team for October's Women's\nWorld Championships, which take place in Ulan-Ude, Russia from October 3 to 13.\n\nIt was announced this week that qualifiers for the Tokyo games next year will\ntake place in London in March 2020 and Paris in May 2020.\n\nAnd O'Rourke, after this spectacular success, will now become a firm medal hope.",

It was a really terrible\nstart  but I actually didn't do that much wrong out there.\n\n\"Luckily, I had a good finish. It's that kind of golf course where you can get\nhot.\n\n\"I definitely need a better start in the final round but as for the back nine, I\nneed more of that!\" Argentine Romero's hopes looked to be fading when he dropped\nthree shots in his opening five holes as McIlroy and Australian Wade Ormsby\nestablished a two-shot lead.\n\nBut as McIlroy and Ormsby suffered late stumbles, Romero came home in 31.\n\nThe 38-year-old produced a brilliant run of scoring on the back nine, going\nbirdieeagle-birdie-birdie from the 13th to edge a shot ahead of Ormsby, who\nbogeyed the last in his round of 67.\n\nChristiaan Bezuidenhout, Lorenzo Gagli and Kalle Samooja are also at 11 under.\n\nThey are a shot clear of 2017 Masters champion Sergio Garcia, Renato Paratore,\nMatthias Schwab and Sebastian Soderberg.",

He struggled at superfeather and didn't\nhave enough in the tank against Farmer.\n\n\"But he will be a major problem at lightweight.\n\n\"He might move on for a big fight in the States. It's always a lot of fun to\nwatch James Tennyson.\n\n\"He has zero fear fighting anyone. He's not got a big name but he can punch. He\nmight have frailties but he can knock anyone out.\n\n\"He's a very exciting TV fighter. I want to say to his manager to skip British\nlevel!\" Hard-hitting Tennyson was hailed by Belfast trainer Ray Ginley as\n'Ireland's biggest puncher, pound for pound', after the win.\n\nOf his 25 pro victories, this was his 21st stoppage.\n\n'Tenny' said: \"I just had to be patient. He was tricky.\n\n\"That proves I'm a full lightweight. The performance showed that my power came\nup a weight with me and it seems to be good.\n\n\"I like to be busy. I'd be more than happy to get two more fights before the end\nof the year.\"\n\nAlso on the card, Russia's Alexander Povetkin beat Hughie Fury by unanimous\ndecision to claim the WBA International heavyweight title.",

My husband is a good person but\ndoes not give me what I truly need and does not make me happy.\n\nWe have come to realise that we are not well matched and we lead pretty separate\nlives but still live in the same house.\n\nI am 34, he is 35 and we have a daughter of 11 and a son of nine. They are\nunaware of our troubles because we don't argue and we do a lot as a family.\n\nI realised that part of finding myself was to understand what I need in a\nrelationship. I started to explore the idea that I might be submissive, in all\naspects of a relationship including sexually.\n\nI met a man online who swept me off my feet. He is 39 and in a hollow marriage\nrather like mine. I felt I'd met my soulmate.\n\nNever before had I enjoyed so much variety in the bedroom and had so much fun\nsocially. He may have taken me a bit out of my comfort zone but he is just\nperfect for me. We manage to meet in a hotel most weeks.\n\nBut today while he was in the shower I saw that he was still logged in to his\nemail on my laptop. I didn't plan to snoop but saw he had signed up to a gay sex\nsite, looking to meet men.\n\nI have asked him before whether he is bisexual and he said no, but I am broken.\nI thought he was perfect but he is not the man I thought I knew.\n\nI haven't said anything to him yet. If I speak to him about it I know he will\nsay that it does not affect his feelings for me, and I do not need to know about\nit.\n\nThis man has given me the most amazing, exciting months of my life but can I\naccept that? He is very open-minded sexually and thinks it is normal to involve\nother people in your sex life so he probably doesn't think that would be\ncheating. I'm still married anyway, so how can I complain about cheating? ?\nDEIDRE SAYS: This has been an exciting adventure for you, but this man doesn't\ncare for you in any meaningful, lasting way.\n\nHe is using you to pursue his own agenda of pushing the sexual boundaries and\nwill always put his wants before your needs.\n\nTruth is, your self-esteem will be pushed lower and lower the longer you keep\nseeing him, quite apart from the risk to your sexual health.\n\nI know you say your marriage is hollow but better settle it one way or the other\nthan let your children think your lack of deep love for each other is normal.\nYou may not argue but they will pick up on the lack of passion.\n\nStop seeing your lover, organise a sexual health check and tell your husband\nit's crunch time - either you rebuild your love for one another or separate so\nyou're both free to find genuinely caring partners.\n\nMy e-leaflet Your Relationship MOT can help you give your marriage the best\nchance.",

I\nnoticed a very attractive nurse. I was wary of asking her out because I am 42\nand she looks half my age.\n\nI gave her a long letter telling her how much I admired her. I said I realised I\nwas too old for her but hoped we could be friends. She thanked me afterwards and\nsaid it was lovely.\n\nI suspect that she then showed some of her colleagues, because the atmosphere\nhas deteriorated. I overheard her telling another nurse I'm a creep. It has got\nto the point where I am relieved now if she is off duty when I visit my mum. I\nhave always treated women with respect but I never seem to have any luck.\n\n0 Deidre SAYS: Nurses often have to be wary of men falling for their caring role\nand not understanding the professional boundaries, but this nurse has been\ninsensitive.\n\nLet it go, as the atmosphere will ease, but focus on building up a social life\nthat includes women so you can get to know them as friends to start with. A\nrelationship can then develop naturally.\n\nMy e-leaflet Finding The Love Of Your Life will help you get started.",

When my fiancée was little, they\nfound a litter of kittens in the garden and he drowned them all.\n\nI am 24. My girlfriend is 23 and is expecting our first child soon. I think this\nis why her dad wants to stay, because we haven't seen him for two years.\n\nI want to get on well with my fiancée's family. Her parents are divorced, so her\nmum won't be visiting with him. Otherwise, I could ask her to keep watch on him.\n\nI don't lose my temper easily but I love our two dogs. They are well behaved and\nI don't know if I could hold myself back from belting this man if he tried to\nhurt them.\n\n0 Deidre SAYS: Does your girlfriend actually want her dad to come to stay? She\nhas a choice, especially if he is a difficult drunk. You can say no together.\n\nIf she truly does want to see him, tell him beforehand that he must not upset\nyour dogs - or you. Watch carefully and, whenever possible, keep a closed door\nbetween her dad and your dogs.\n\nIf he really has a drink problem, though, alcohol may undo everyone's best\nintentions - and then you'd best insist he leave.\n\nDear Deidre I AM at the end of my tether.\n\nI have two sons and a daughter. The boys hate one another.\n\nThere is never a moment's peace in our home. They have to share a room but\notherwise I have to separate them all the time. They are 12 and 13. My daughter\nis just nine.\n\nBoth the boys have had problems at school. I'm 37 and have to deal with this\nmyself, as my husband and I live apart. He sees the children when he can.\n\nThe eldest one seems angry with the world just about all the time. He can be\naggressive and rude to adults and to his teachers. When he is annoyed about\nsomething, he cannot let it go.

            "content_plain": "HE was once told he would never be an actor by his school teachers  but now\nPacky Lee is the \"only one\" Tommy Shelby trusts in Peaky Blinders.\n\nThe Belfast man has played Johnny Dogs in all five seasons so far  the gypsy\nright-hand man of boss Tommy Shelby.\n\nIn last Sunday's episode, the gangster told Packy's character he was the \"only\none in the world he trusts\".\n\nBut if Packy had listened to his secondary school teachers, he would have never\nmade it to where he is now  a star in one of the BBC's biggest shows.\n\nHe told us: \"If you said it now, people would say, 'OK, fair play to you.' But\n25 years ago, if I said I wanted to be an actor, people laughed at me. That's\nbeing honest.\n\n\"I asked if I could move school because my school didn't do GSCE drama. And they\ncalled my parents in, got them into a room and they said, 'Now you listen to me\nMr Lee and Mrs Lee, your son is from West Belfast and there are no opportunities\nor jobs in any industry of acting that he would classify for. It's just not\npossible. So why would he move school to be an actor when the job criteria is\ncertainly not available?' \"But with the help of the other school, Corpus\nChristie College, I moved school, I did my GSCE drama, and I didn't look back.\n\n\"But I've bumped into a few of those teachers who were in that committee board\nwho were the ones who giggled and laughed at me wanting to leave.\n\n\"It's great to see them now. I'm just being honest. I'm not rude at all, I'm\nvery polite but there was no belief. If you don't believe, you're the one\nletting other people down and stopping them fulfilling their dreams.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't only the teachers who gave him a hard time.\n\nPacky recalled: \"Bullies in school because you're into drama ... people don't\nlike that  they want you to play football. 'Look at him he's a sissy.' When\nyou're going to the Arts theatre on Saturday instead of going to play football,\nsome people just don't like playing with you or hanging around with you as young\nkids.\n\n\"But that's all changed because I believed in what I wanted to do and in my\ndreams that they're bigger than Saturday afternoon football.\n\n\"If I wanted to be a footballer then I would be there on the Saturday afternoon\nbut I didn't. I wanted to be the actor, I wanted to learn the lines, I wanted to\nbe different people, different individuals.\"\n\nAnd he said he had to work \"ten times harder\" than those who went to acting\nschool.\n\nHe said: \"I couldn't afford drama school so I am what I am. As much as I would\nhave loved to have gone to drama school, I was able to do it a different way.\n\n\"I made sure I have a career, made sure I have a bit of work as an actor that I\ncan walk into a job but also bring money home to provide for a family.\n\n\"I had a different mindset to other people who were able to get a scholarship\nand who were able to go to drama school and do the three years.\n\n\"Every time I got an audition, I give it that wee bit extra attention because\nthe opportunities didn't come that often.\n\n\"But now, all of a sudden because of Peaky Blinders, I'm in a different\ncategory.\n\n\"I'm up for different work, I'm doing different work and I'm very proud of it.\n\n\"But I'm also very real, I know I am just an actor and a normal person like\neverybody else, I do the normal things that we all do.\n\n\"I walk to the shopping centre and I'm doing messages and people will stop me\nand go, 'You do your own shopping?' Are you for real? 'Do you not have someone\nwho does it for you?' What do people think I am? \"I'm just an average guy from\nWest Belfast in an extraordinary job. And because the show is so massive at the\nminute, it's made the job that bit more extraordinary.\" Fans of the show love\nthe gypsy Johnny, but they may be surprised to know he was only meant to appear\nfor one episode. Packy recalled: \"I was only cast for one day, I was only meant\nto do one day.\n\n\"They obviously enjoyed what I'd done, Steven enjoyed what I did and we chatted\nabout that and they kept me alive in it.\"\n\nSpeaking about his co-star, Cork man Ci said: \"I have but also grea \"I had kno\ntheatre worl script and I do it based o I didn't think sons and be cast  wow!\n\nillian Murphy, Packy e great respect for, at fun with, Cillian. own Cillian from\nthe ld and I saw the was very happy to on him doing it.

He said: \"I've worked with Cillian a lot and\nobviously with Aidan. There's that moment before where it's funny, we all change\naccents.\n\n\"Cillian changes, Aidan changes, I change and it's hilarious. Then it's one,\ntwo, three cut, and we're back to our normal accents  you can see people who\naren't fully aware of our accents going, 'Oh, hello.' \"Aidan's decided to take\nhis gypsy accent to England, which is great, and I've decided to have mine south\nand Cillian's got Birmingham. But then, we as men have three completely\ndifferent accents between Cork, Dublin and Belfast.\n\n\"So it's great to stand and slag with the boys from Ireland and we're very proud\nthat we're showing off the Irish talent. Please don't think we're not, we are,\nand it's the one thing we're very aware of.\"\n\nThe show has a massive Irish cast, with Brian Gleeson, Charlene McKenna and\nEmmett J Scanlan joining this season, while Ned Dennehy and Charlie Murphy\nreturn.\n\nAnd this season's director, Anthony Byrne, like last year's David Caffrey, are\nboth Irish also, with Packy joking: \"Soon it will be all Irish.\"\n\n\" Now in its fifth season,ason, he praised show writer Knight as a \"genius\",\nboss\" Cillian.\n\nSteven and \"the with no actor, mindderory He said: \"To be fair, disrespect to\nany other Cillian is absolutely mindblowing in the part.\n\nhe tne \"Cillian and Paul Anderson and Helen McCrory and Sophie Rundle, the\nfamily of four are outstanding in every scene they do.\n\n\"I'm not surprised that Steven wants to keep writing for them.

But it does take him a bit of\ntime, as he says, to wind down afterwards, get out of it, let his hair down.\n\n\"I'm nowhere near the level of Cillian, but every day on set he is setting the\nexample and leading by example, and it's great to be involved.\n\n\"At the end of the day, he's boss.

Hubert's car crashed heavily into the barriers and sprung back on to\nthe race track and was struck by Juan Manuel Correa, who was travelling behind\nand had no chance of swerving out of the way.\n\nCorrea's car ripped through Hubert's Arden, splitting it in two. Race stewards\nstopped and cancelled the race, while marshals and medics raced to help.\n\nHubert (below), who won the GP3 championship last season, was part of the\nRenault Academy.\n\nA statement from the sport's governing body said: \"The FIA regrets to advise\nthat a serious incident involving cars 12, 19 and 20 occurred at 17:07 on August\n31 as a part of the FIA Formula 2 Feature Race at Spa-Francorchamps. The scene\nwas immediately attended by emergency and medical crews, and all drivers were\ntaken to the medical centre.\n\n\"As a result of the incident, the FIA regrets to inform that the driver of car\n#19, Antoine Hubert, succumbed to his injuries, and passed away at 18:35.\"\n\nAmerican driver Correa was said to be in a stable condition and being treated in\nhospital as a result of his leg injuries.\n\nHubert is the first person to die as a result of injuries at a Grand Prix\nmeeting since Frenchman Jules Bianchi at the 2014 Japanese GP.\n\nBianchi crashed at Suzuka and died nine months later in a Nice hospital at the\nage of 25. F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton was being interviewed when he\nwatched in shock as Hubert's car collided with Correa.\n\nHamilton, 34, wrote on Instagram: \"This is devastating. God rest your soul\nAnthoine. My prayers and thoughts are with you and your family.\n\n\"If a single one of you watching and enjoying this sport think for a second what\nwe do is safe, you're highly mistaken.\n\n\"All the drivers put their lives on the line when they hit the track and people\nneed to appreciate that in a serious way because it is not appreciated enough.\n\n\"Not from the fans nor some of the people actually working in the sport.\n\"Anthoine is a hero for taking the risk he did to chase his dreams. I'm so sad.\nRest in peace brother.\" The tragedy casts a huge cloud over today's F1 race\nwhere Ferrari's Charles Leclerc starts on pole after Hamilton crashed during\nfinal practice.\n\nThe British racer spun twice in the German GP while he crashed during final\npractice at Spa meaning his team had a race against time to repair his car for\nqualifying.\n\nHamilton then almost crashed into his team-mate Valtteri Bottas  who he leads\nby 62 points in the standings  in a crazy qualifying that was stopped twice due\nto engine fires.\n\nHamilton (left) said: \"I'm only human, it happens sometimes. It was a massive\nchallenge for the team to rebuild my car. They did a great job.\"\n\nHamilton will start in third behind Sebastian Vettel and Leclerc.",

With any player.\"\n\nChelsea are planning to hold talks with Twitter to try to weed out a problem\nwhich is not just restricted to their club.\n\nEngland women's head coach Phil Neville called for a Twitter boycott to force\nthem to police postings better.\n\nLampard blamed his whole team for ignoring warnings about slacking off on the\npitch.\n\nChelsea blew a twogoal lead and have now conceded NINE GOALS in four league\ngames since he took over in the summer.\n\nAbraham's double had the Blues cruising before Callum Robinson netted for\nSheffield United and then Zouma put through his own net.\n\nLampard said: \"We switched off in a game we should be comfortably seeing out at\n2-0 up  and that's no disrespect to Sheffield United.\n\n\"It's not defence, it's conceding as a team.\"\n\nRookie midfielder Billy Gilmour, 18, was handed his Blues debut late on.\n\nLampard said: \"I've got faith in Billy. He is going to have a big future. We\nhave a transfer ban, so the squad is what it is.\"",

            "content_plain": "OLE GUNNAR SOLSKJAER claimed Paul Pogba will NOT be making a last-minute move\nfrom Manchester United.\n\nReal Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, who has been trying to sign his fellow\nFrenchman all summer, said he would spring one or two \"surprises\" before the\nEuropean transfer window closes on Monday night.\n\nBut United boss Solskjaer said: \"Paul Pogba will be playing for us.\"\n\nThe Norwegian also defended Pogba's role in the 1-1 draw with ten-man\nSouthampton at St Mary's, which means United have made their worst start to a\nseason since 1992.\n\nThey scored first through Daniel James but their passing became sloppy to allow\nSouthampton back into it, Pogba being the worst culprit.\n\nSolskjaer added: \"I think as a team after about half an hour we started giving\nsloppy balls away.\n\n\"Paul was one of them but he wasn't any different to anyone else. As a team we\ndidn't play well.\n\n\"In the last half an hour, he did create loads for us going forward.\n\n\"Everyone expects everything from him in every game.\n\n\"He has to defend, he has to attack, he has to win headers, he has to win\ntackles, he has to dribble, he has to make passes.\n\n\"That's just Paul and he'll thrive on that.\" Pogba limped off with an ankle\ninjury but Solskjaer expects him to join up with France for international duty.\n\nThe draw, United's third game without a win since the opening weekend thumping\nof Chelsea, means they have just five points from four games.\n\nBack in 1992-93, Alex Ferguson's side managed four points yet went on to win the\ntitle.\n\nThere is no hope of Solskjaer's side pulling off the same feat.\n\nBut he insisted they are moving in the right direction as he bids to return to\nthe club's tradition of playing on the front foot rather than counter-attacking.\n\nHe said: \"You can say it's a long-term plan but we deserved to win the last\nthree games as well.\n\n\"We dominated the last three games and we know we are on the right track,\ngetting used to that way of playing.\n\n\"The one thing you cannot control in football is results and outcomes.\n\n\"You can keep control of the effort, the attitude, what we're doing in training.\n\n\"We're on the right track, we're working.\n\n\"And, as I said to the boys, we have to learn to win these games.\n\n\"I know we are a young team but that's not an excuse. We have plenty of\nquality.\"\n\nUnited were pegged back by Jannik Vestergaard's towering header for Saints.\n\nAnd former Red Devils and England defender Rio Ferdinand was critical of their\ndefence as Victor Lindelof was beaten in the air for the second game in a row.\n\nFerdinand said: \"They'll be disappointed with that. The defeat against Palace\nand this today doesn't look great.\n\n\"They had Southampton by the scruff of the neck and they were there for the\ntaking.\n\n\"They let them off the hook and that will be the disappointing thing for the\nmanagement.\n\n\"They've had one clean sheet in 19 games and that tells you everything you need\nto know.\n\n\"They need to be more commanding.\n\n\"They look weak at set-pieces and were undone by a another one.\n\n\"Far too often United haven't got it right defensively. At no point do the\ndefenders get tight to Vestergaard, who gets a free run.\n\n\"They are passing the buck. This is about personal pride, 'Am I doing all I\ncan?'.\"\n\nUnited's shining light was once again summer signing James.\n\nThe Wales international, 21, struck a brilliant tenth-minute goal to make it\nthree in four games and was his team's most consistent threat.\n\nSolksjaer added: \"He's come in and made an impact ever since day one in\ntraining.\n\n\"I think he's an example to everyone in football.\n\n\"He's had his period of loans and didn't get games.\n\n\"Now he is our top scorer and that comes through in his personality and his\nhabits.\n\n\"He's humble and works hard.\n\nHe knows he can improve.\n\n\"He could have scored one or two more today and we will work with him to get his\nquality even higher.\n\n\"We will have a top player there.\"\n\nSouthampton head coach Ralph Hasenhuttl was delighted with the way his side held\nout after defender Kevin Danso was sent off for a second bookable offence.\n\nThe Austrian said: \"I'm very proud of my team and of our stadium and the crowd,\nhow they pushed us at the end and energised us.\n\n\"It was very important after this tough week, with this third game in a week and\ninjuries, then the red card.\n\n\"In the end, it was only about the character and mentality of our team.\n\n\"And the guys showed it and deserved to get this point.\"\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED had a penalty turned down late on but it was a tough call for\nref Mike Dean.\n\nDid Southampton midfielder Stuart Armstrong play the ball? No. Did Armstrong\nmake contact with United forward Mason Greenwood (above)? Yes. If Dean had given\na penalty at St Mary's then VAR would not have overturned the decision because\nit was a subjective decision and not a clear and obvious error. The official was\nin an excellent position  and in real time I can understand why he did not\nthink it was a penalty.",

            "content_plain": "STRICTLY'S Craig Revel Horwood issued a grovelling apology last night after\nsaying celebs should sleep with their pro partners like Stacey Dooley to win.\n\nThe acid-tongued judge, 54, admitted he had made a \"huge error\" and he deeply\nregretted his \"hurtful\" jibe, made during filming on Friday night.\n\nLast year's champ Stacey  now dating former dance partner Kevin Clifton  was\nsitting in the audience with her family at the time. Filming was halted as aides\nrushed over to them, but her mum Di stormed from the Strictly studio.\n\nBBC sources said Craig was savaged by bosses for the \"totally unacceptable\"\nremark  and ordered to apologise.\n\nCraig said last night: \"I'm deeply sorry for the offence caused to Kevin and\nStacey and everyone who works on the show.\n\n\"I recognise that what I said was hurtful, cruel and incredibly disrespectful.\nIt was a huge error of judgment that I very much regret.\"\n\nIt came after reigning champions Stacey and Kevin took to the ballroom floor\nduring filming for the pre-recorded launch show, which will be aired next\nweekend.\n\nFollowing their performance, host Tess Daly asked the panel  Craig, Bruno\nTonioli, Shirley Ballas and newcomer Motsi Mabuse  for their advice to this\nyear's contestants.\n\nCraig initially told her the wannabes should be inspired by documentary-maker\nStacey, 32.\n\nHe said she had been \"dragged up from the dance gutter\" before winning the show.\n\nBut he then added spitefully: \"Of course, if you sleep with your dance partner\nthat helps...\"\n\nSources said the snide remark sent shockwaves around the studio, and horrified\nbosses immediately called for filming to be halted.\n\nWorried aides flocked to Stacey and her family while executive producers\nimmediately decided to scrap the footage.\n\nThe hosts, panel and audience were then asked to return to their places to\nrefilm the sequence.\n\nOne source said: \"It was an awful moment. Craig was obviously trying to be\nfunny, but realised as soon as he said it that he had gone too far.\n\n\"The audience was visibly shocked, as was Tess Daly and the other judges.\n\n\"Immediately after he made the comment, 'cut' was called, and chaos broke out.\n\n\"Several aides rushed over to Stacey and her family to check if they were OK.\nThey were all stunned, and Stacey's mum obviously wasn't OK at all.\n\n\"She looked very upset, and soon after that she left the studio.\n\n\"The bosses were absolutely furious with Craig and wasted no time in taking him\nto one side afterwards and telling him the remark was totally unacceptable.\n\n\"They encouraged him to make a full apology to Stacey and Kevin, which he was\nhappy to do.\n\n\"He knows that what he said was completely out of line.\"\n\nThe launch show for this year's series will be screened on BBC1 next Saturday.\n\nDays before filming, Stacey had shared her excitement about returning to\nStrictly on social media with a series of photographs backstage. One, showing\nher having her hair done, was retweeted by proud mum Di.\n\nAnd boyfriend Kevin, 36, posted a heart emoji underneath the shot.\n\nThe Irish Sun on Sunday revealed in April how Stacey was secretly dating the\ndancer after ditching her long-term boyfriend Sam Tucknott.\n\nThe pair were said to have grown close while filming the show, with their\non-screen chemistry helping them sail through to the final last December.\n\nAfter winning the trophy, Stacey gushed about her partner: \"I should say\nsomething quite poignant, shouldn't I? You know how highly I think of you. I\nthink you are the biggest gem. It's no surprise you have been in the final as\nmany times as you have.\n\n\"It's daunting doing something you haven't done before. But he's so patient and\nhe walks you through. You so deserve this.\"\n\nKevin replied: \"Thank you so much, not just for being so amazing and for dancing\nso well, but for being the most wonderful person to work with, to spend every\nday training with.\n\n\"You've worked so hard. You are so lovely and I think the absolute world of\nyou.\"\n\nKevin supported Stacey as she performed on the Strictly Come Dancing Live tour \ndespite not taking part himself. In January they were seen apparently sharing a\nhotel date in Birmingham.\n\nStacey and personal trainer Sam, 30, ended their five-year relationship in\nMarch.\n\nBut Sam got a shock when the pair cleared out their Brighton flat on April 1. He\nspotted a text from Kevin on Stacey's phone which read: \"I love you.\"\n\nStacey, who has a €270,000-ayear golden handcuffs deal with the BBC, later\ntexted Sam to insist she had only fallen for Kevin once the couple had\nseparated.\n\nBut her explanation failed to reassure Sam, who branded Kevin a \"rat\" and a\n\"snake\". Stacey and Kevin's relationship has since gone from strength to\nstrength.\n\nIn July, Stacey broke her silence on the romance to gush about \"amazing\" Kevin \nwho was previously married to Strictly pro Karen Clifton.\n\nShe told a newspaper: \"What I am happy to say is, 'Kev's amazing, I'm happy,\nlife happens, I've got an amazing career and I'm very lucky.'\" A BBC source said\nlast night of the judge's comment: \"Craig was told in no uncertain terms that\nthis was completely unacceptable.\n\n\"It goes against everything the show stands for and it's right that he's issued\na full apology.\"\n\n@IrishSunOnline\n\nWHAT HE SAID TO TESS 6Stacey was dragged up from the dance gutter..of course, if\nyou sleep with your dance partner that helps7",

            "content_plain": "TELLY star Martin King today reveals the double heartbreak he suffered losing\nboth parents within the space of a month.\n\nMum Christina Boyle, lost her battle with dementia just over four weeks after\nhis father, Martin Boyle, died suddenly in Dublin's Beaumont Hospital on Easter\nMonday.\n\nSpeaking for the first time about his heartbreaking loss, Martin, 56, told the\nIrish Sun on Sunday: \"It's been tough, very tough.\n\n\"My mother died four weeks and a day after my dad passed away. In the weeks\nafter they'd both gone, I felt like it wasn't me going through all this.\n\n\"Then the reality of it would sink in, it was me. That both my mum and dad were\ngone. That this had actually happened.\"\n\nGrieving Six O'Clock Show host Martin has revealed the turmoil he faced after\nbeing told not to tell his mother, who was in hospital with dementia, that his\ndad had died.\n\nHe said: \"My dad was fine up to that. We were expecting my mother to die. Then\nmy dad died suddenly.\n\n\"We were told by doctors not to tell my mother that my dad had died so we\ndidn't.\n\n\"We didn't say anything to her about it. The strange thing is that my mother\nworked it out.\n\n\"You see even when people are suffering from dementia, they can suddenly have\nmoments of clarity and that's what happened. My mother woke up one day and put\ntwo and two together.\n\n\"She told us, 'Your dad hasn't come in to see me in the hospital and he hasn't\nbeen in a very long time.' She worked out that he had died. Then it was just two\ndays later that she died herself.\"\n\nMam Christina  or Chrissie  passed away at the TLC Carton Nursing Home in\nRaheny, Dublin surrounded by her family.\n\nAnd Martin added: \"Because at my father's funeral, we'd asked for no flowers and\nonly donations towards Dementia Research, people thought dad had dementia.\n\n\"But he'd been fine, my mother was the one suffering from dementia. Now I'd lost\nthem both.\"\n\nPopular presenter Martin paid tribute to his photographer wife Jenny for getting\nhim through the month of hell along with his family in Virgin Media TV.\n\nPreviously writing on social media, Jenny said: \"There really are no words ...\nMartin's beautiful, beautiful mam and my second mam, Chrissie, has left this\nworld one month and one day after losing her husband, Martin's dad.\n\n\"I guess he just wanted her with him again. Two beautiful souls back together\nforever. Life will never, ever be the same but their love for each other lives\non in their children and grandchildren.\"\n\nBut Martin admits he had to be talked out of going back to work too soon after\ntheir deaths.\n\nHe said: \"I tried to go back to work a week after my dad died and then I\nrealised I'd be working on the same day he died the previous week, I'm glad I\ntook another day out.\n\n\"Then when my mother died, (Virgin Media boss) Pat Kiely and the team were\nfantastic and said take a few weeks off, which I did, and it helped.\"\n\nThe Q102 host said Michael Buble played a key role in his grieving when he went\nto see him play at Dublin's 3Arena in early June.\n\nMartin said: \"The first night out I had with Jenny after my parents died was a\nMichael Buble concert.\n\n\"The gig was fantastic then right out of the blue in the middle, Michael started\ntalking about the BIG Buble's helped recent death of his grandfather who lived\nto be 92.\n\nwas say \"He said when he told people his grandfather had died and what age he\nwas, they'd say, 'He lived to a right old age and you had a great time\ntogether'. Michael said he thought that was bulls**t, as he wanted those good\ntimes with his grandfather to just keep going and going.\"\n\nGIG Martin's real name  just like story Martin's dad  is Martin Boyle. But\nMartin Jnr was forced to change his name early on because of the duo's\nrespective careers.\n\nHe previously said: \"When I was 15 I started working for the Big D, which was a\npirate radio station.\n\n\"I took the position to earn money while my father was in hospital. But once I\ngot the chance to present he was already out of hospital, thank God. At the time\nhe worked in the Post and Telegraph service, and his job was to shut down pirate\nradio stations.\"\n\nAt the time it was policy in his father's line of work for anyone with relatives\nworking in an illegal radio station to be suspended.\n\nSo when the opportunity came for Martin to host his show, he had a discussion\nwith his producer over what his pseudonym would be.\n\nHe added: \"I said I'll stick with my birth name but I couldn't use Boyle, so we\ndiscussed it for a bit.\n\n\"The producer asked me, 'Who are your idols?' But Martin Best, Cruyff and Ali\ndidn't sound right.\n\n\"Eventually I said Martin Luther King, but obviously I couldn't use Luther, so\nwe went for Martin King. The rest is history.\"\n\nThe working class Dub also revealed how he almost quit his job starting out as a\nDJ working for Sunshine FM.\n\nThe broadcaster told how he was asked by his station manager to split from his\nfriends in the Edenmore estate in north Dublin where he grew up.\n\nMartin explained: \"I remember a manager at the station telling me that the only\nway I could succeed was for me to leave the area I grew up in and all my\nfriends.\n\n\"You had to sound like you were drowning somewhere in the mid-Atlantic, and of\ncourse everyone was hiding their regional accent at the time to try and improve\ntheir diction.\n\n\"In hindsight he may have been looking out for my best interests, but I was a\nyoung lad and I didn't want to leave the area  so I left the station instead.\"\n\nMartin is one of the longest surviving faces on Virgin Media, formerly known as\nTV3.\n\nAnd fans of Ireland's most famous weatherman will be delighted to see him\nfeaturing so prominently along with pal Alan Hughes in the new autumn promos for\nthe station.\n\nThis comes after long-standing colleagues of similar vintage, Mark Cagney and\nAidan Cooney, exited Ireland AM and the station.\n\nCagney, 63, stepped down from the show earlier in July after two decades\npresenting. Cooney also left the station earlier this year.\n\nQuizzed if he ever felt he could be next, Martin said: \"No. I've never felt\nthat. I was sad to see Mark go but thrilled to hear him covering the breakfast\nshow on Newstalk.\n\n\"The young folks don't know that Mark was and is the king of radio. This is part\nthree for Mark and I'll be listening in.\" @KenSweeney",

The behaviour is deplorable. It's getting\nout of control. It reiterates the GRA's policy that there needs to be mandatory\nsentencing for all assaults and attacks on gardai.\"\n\nThe van has now been removed for technical and forensic examination.\n\nLocals claim they heard up to five gunshots after seeing the Garda vehicle in\nthe area.\n\nLast night, a Garda spokesman said: \"No one was injured and both Garda members\ninvolved remained on duty. The van has since been removed for technical and\nforensic examination.\n\n\"Investigating gardai are appealing for witnesses.\n\n\"Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room at Coolock Garda\nStation 01 6664 200 or the Garda Confidential Line 1800 666 111.\"\n\n@IrishSunOnline",

            "content_plain": "htes A BRUNETTE pictured with Wayne Rooney in a hotel at 5.30am has told how he\nearlier stripped to his pants in front of three women at a boozy Jacuzzi party.\n\ntty hd Karra Granados, seen in last week's Irish Sun on Sunday getting in a\nhotel lift with Rooney, said the footie star and four DC United team-mates all\nstripped to their skivvies during a wild seven-hour night out.\n\nl gse e Karra, 27, said: \"Wayne took off his jeans and was dipping his feet in\nthe water. He joined in with everyone else. He had tight boxers on  they were\nblue and I think they were Calvin Klein.'' She also told how Rooney and one\nteam-mate took her back to their hotel at 5.30am after the Jacuzzi party ended \nwhere the Manchester United legend fell asleep and she romped with his friend.\n\nKarra added: \"It was a crazy night  Wayne partied so hard with the others. It\nwas very intense. Everyone was going for it and Wayne was definitely letting his\nhair down, joining in with everybody. He was in very good spirits.\n\n\"I think Wayne just wanted to feel like a normal guy on a night out, not a\nfamous person.\"\n\nKarra told how she hooked up with Rooney, 33, and team-mates following a DC\nUnited match in Vancouver on August 17.\n\nShe was with friends at nightclub Twelve West when they were given a VIP table\nnext to Rooney's group.\n\nShe said she poked fun at Rooney because he looked scruffy in a grey hoodie and\nbaseball cap.\n\nKarra said: \"I wasn't really paying attention to his party. But I almost spilled\na drink on one of them and we began chatting.\n\n\"I had no idea who Wayne Rooney was but someone mentioned that he was a famous\nfootballer.\"\n\nWhile in the club Rooney, believed to be drinking rum and cokes, was pictured\ndeep in conversation with a second woman  a brunette wearing black leather\ntrousers. Pictures showed him putting his arms around her waist and her leaning\nin closely to whisper in his ear.\n\nRooney later insisted the woman was \"simply one of many who innocently asked for\nautographs\".\n\nKarra, who did not know the woman, said: \"They looked like they were quite\nclose, she was flirtatious.\n\n\"I didn't see her getting his autograph.\" Karra's account of that night fills in\na few details that Rooney omitted when he responded angrily on social media to\nour story.\n\nShe told how the woman in the a te an Pierre's Champ picture was asked to join\nher, Rooney and team-mates as they headed to another club, called Champagne\nLounge. After they all clambered into a limo, Rooney turned his attention\ntowards lawyer's assistant Karra.\n\nShe said: \"Wayne's team-mate grabbed me by the hand and put me in the limo.\n\n\"He was pushing everyone in but there wasn't much room. Wayne said 'Come and sit\nhere next to me'.\n\n\"He put his arm around me.\n\nThe other girl was on the other side of the limo.\"\n\nOnce in Pierre's the other woman disappeared  and Karra found herself as the\nonly girl on Rooney's table as waiters brought them drinks.\n\nAfter about an hour Karra, Rooney, two other women and four team-mates were\ninvited back to a barman's apartment.\n\nIt had a shared swimming pool and a Jacuzzi  which the group ended up using in\nthe early hours of the morning. Karra told how Rooney whipped off his jeans,\nrevealing blue Calvin Klein underpants, and dipped his legs into the water of\nthe Jacuzzi.\n\nHis team-mates also stripped to their underwear.\n\nThe two other women, friends of the barman, swam in the adjacent pool. Karra\nsaid: \"Wayne joined in with everyone else. He had tight boxers on.\n\n\"He kept his shirt on but his jeans got wet when they were laid out beside the\nhot tub.\n\n\"When he put them back on it looked like he had p***** him-himself. I was making\nfun of him about it.\"\n\nAt about 5.30am Rooney and one of his team-mates invited Karra with them back to\ntheir hotel, the Hyatt Regency.\n\nShe said: \"We went up in the lift together and all chatted for a bit. Then\nWayne, who just seemed absolutely exhausted, went to sleep.\"\n\nKarra said she ended up kissing and cuddling the team-mate. She added: \"I moved\nover to his bed and we kissed.\n\n\"I was really tired so later I called a cab and went home.\"\n\nKarra said she was devastated when she discovered the player she kissed was\nmarried.\n\nShe added: \"Nothing would have happened between us if I had known.\n\n\"Wayne was such a gentleman the whole time.\n\n\"But I'm not sure his wife would be happy to hear he stripped to his underpants\nin a hot tub in front of women.\"\n\n@IrishSunOnline",

            "content_plain": "ISLAND-hopping has never been easier in the Philippines as internal flights for\nas little as €15 connect these tropical paradises.\n\nOnce a destination exclusively for intrepid travellers and broke backpackers,\nthe Philippines is fast becoming a holiday haven for all.\n\nAn archipelago nation of pristine beaches with sugar-white sand and\ncyan-coloured swells, the Philippines is still relatively undiscovered in\ncomparison to the rest of Southeast Asia.\n\nLast year marked an unprecedented surge in visitor numbers, topping 7.1 million,\nhowever these figures are minuscule to Thailand' who had 34.5 million tourists\nvisit.\n\nHaving wrestled with the crowds of Thailand and Bali, where throngs of Irish and\nBrits now holiday, I was lured to the Philippines with promises of a calmer way\nof life.\n\nBeyond the crazed chaos of the Philippines cities lie over 7,000 islands, many\nof which are uninhabited.\n\nUntil recent years, these idyllic isles were cut off from tourists, with limited\naccess it took days to reach a destination.\n\nBut now with Cebu Pacific opening up more flight paths to connect the many\nislands of the Philippines, the country is easier than ever to travel around. I\ntook advantage of such flights and island-hopped through this beautiful country\nfor three weeks forking over as little as €15 per flight. Once cut-off corners\nare now easily accessible, as well as improvements in both hospitality and\naccommodation now make travelling the Philippines more appealing to more than\njust the penny-pinching traveller.\n\nI began my adventure around the Pearl of the Orient with a flight from Manilla\nto Caticlan Airport, in Boracay. Boracay Beach has recently reopened after a\nshock government closer. Dubbed a \"cesspool\" for its outdated and insufficient\nsewerage plans, the powder-white beach is now restored to former glory thanks to\na mass clean-up and regeneration project.\n\nBoracay is a great place to acclimate and recover from the jetlag (flight time\nis approximately 17 hours from Dublin!).\n\nWhite Beach, named appropriately so, is the go-to place for beachside\naccommodation, with sand so dazzling it's almost impossible to look at it\nwithout sunglasses.\n\nFANGTASTIC...golden spider The beaches of the Philippines closely resemble the\nfamous Indian Ocean atolls, the Maldives, but at half the price.\n\nWith so much of this coral-reefed beauty to see, it's crucial to have a plan A\nquick flight from Boracay to neighbouring island Cebu didn't break the bank at\n€15, where I then hopped on a bus to the seaside town of Moalboal. The\nspectacular sight of the sardine run as well as the gorgeous Kawasan Falls are\njust some of the tourist draws to the sleepy fishing village.\n\nOnce a nature lover's most prized secret, Kawasan Falls is now one of the most\nfamous landmarks in the nation, thanks largely to social media.\n\nThousands visit the area every day, but I rose before sunrise, rented a scooter\nand zipped off to the falls solo.\n\nweb Arriving shortly before 8am, I found the falls completely empty, with no\nsound other than the splashing mountain water and the rustling treetops from the\nmonkeys above.\n\nMy next port of call was the island of Bohol, where I was rewarded for my long\nday of travel once again with sights of flourwhite sand and glistening waters.\nTop notch snorkel spots are a dime a peso here, with spotted sharks,\nheavy-lidded turtles and curious cuttlefish populating the waters off Bohol's\nAlona Beach.\n\nThe ocean isn't the only place where nature flourishes in the Philippines.\nMeter-long monitor lizards, giant flying foxes and spiders the size of your palm\nare all the norm in this tropical ecosystem.\n\nOn the slightly cuddlier side, the pocket-sized tarsier monkey flies the flag\nfor the less intimidating of the native wildlife.\n\nThe other-worldly underwater Mecca continued in the province of Palawan, an\nisland west of Cebu and accessible again, by a cheapas-chips flight.\n\nThis idyllic island, comprising of nearly 2,000 small surrounding islets, has\nwon Best Island in the World three years running.\n\nPalawan first gained attention thanks to its feature in Hollywood blockbusters,\nThe Bourne Legacy and James Bond's The World Is Not Enough.\n\nIt is also rumoured that this rustic paradise was the true inspiration for Alex\nGarland's The Beach.\n\nEl Nido, Coron and Port Barton are the places to be in Palawan, with their\ntowering mountains, limestone caves and turquoise lagoons. Unfortunately,\ngetting around Palawan is no easy feat and involves a lot of white-knuckle\ndriving.\n\nUnless you're okay with slumming it in a van with a dozen or so backpackers,\nwinding through the hilltops for six hours, it is advised once again to board a\nplane.\n\nFlights from Puerto Princesa leave to every corner of Palawan daily, so save\nyourself the hassle and book via Skyscanner.\n\nPalawan is where I spent the majority of my time.\n\nEach day was spent immersed with the convivial locals and Filipino culture.\nChristianity is strong in the Philippines  80 per cent of the population is\nRoman Catholic. This coulde be why I, being Irish, was greeted with wide smiles.\n\nThe Filipinos are welcoming, with English widely spoken, often with an American\ntwang in the cities.\n\nEven the island children have a phrase or two, eager to learn as future income\ndepends on it. Tourism is crucial to the Philippines' economy, accounting for\n11pc of its GDP.\n\nI idled my time away exploring these majestic beaches and eating in seafront\nrestaurants. The cuisine, which is heavy on fresh seafood, is a melting pot of\ninternational flavours.\n\nYou will never have to worry about your bank balance while in this pocket of the\nworld, with a locally cooked meal costing over average just €2.50.\n\nLike Bohol, the seas surrounding Palawan are teeming with fish of every colour,\nand iridescent blue starfish litter the seabed. Island tours are popular from El\nNido, where your traditional banca boat will weave in and out of secret lagoons.\n\nAt night, electricity and running water is limited on the island. As my time\ncame to an end, I wondered how I would sleep back home without the soundtrack of\na distant humming generator, lapping waves and squawking geckos.\n\n KEELIN RILEY GO: THE PHILIPPINES GETTNG THERE: Fly from Dublin for a little as\n€619 with Turkish Airlines, Emirates, or Etihad or Qatar Airways.\n\nTOUR: Hayes and Jarvis specialise in escorted tours and family holidays to the\nPhilippines.

            "content_plain": "GARDAI have been urged to \"exercise extreme caution\" when dealing with one of\nIreland's most dangerous criminals.\n\nNotorious thug Leon Wright, 31, is back on the streets after walking free from\nprison early on Friday.\n\nThe psycho had been serving a 13-year term for a string of violent offences.\nAside from his shocking attacks on the outside, the monster previously carried\nout assaults on prison officers who were so wary of the brute they had to wear\nriot gear when interacting with him.\n\nToday the Irish Sun on Sunday can reveal Wright's release has sparked a major\nGarda alert.\n\nOfficers have been warned Wright  whose rap sheet is littered with assault,\nrobbery, threats to kill and other shocking crimes  is \"an extremely violent\nindividual\".\n\nGardai were told Wright \"does not react well to authority in any shape or form\"\nas cops were urged to \"exercise extreme caution when dealing with him\".\n\nA special directive declared: \"Assess all risk before engaging with Leon\nWright.\"\n\nThe Irish Sun on Sunday has learned Wright is currently staying in a half-way\nhouse in the Coolock area of north Dublin.\n\nThe man dubbed Ireland's most dangerous inmate walked free from the Midlands\nPrison in the early hours of Friday. Wright has more than 100 previous\nconvictions, including robberies, 34 assaults and firearms offences.\n\nThe crazed beast had been locked up in the Midlands Prison's National Violence\nReduction Unit  a €2.7m specialist facility designed to hold prisoners who have\na high propensity for extreme violence.\n\nDuring his time inside, he has attacked dozens of prison officers and been\ndisciplined 212 times.\n\nPrison bosses tried to curb Wright's violent outbursts, including giving him his\nown punching bag to take his aggression out on.\n\nHe was also given a Playstation and a fish tank to pacify him.\n\nBut Wright attacked over two dozen guards while in jail and left many with\nserious injuries, triggering the use of teams in riot gear for any interactions\nwith him.\n\nThe \"very dangerous\" serial offender was given a 13-year prison sentence in 2007\nfor a litany of violent crimes, including robbery, hijacking, assault and\nthreatening to kill gardai.\n\nWright stabbed a youth in the leg during a robbery at Stephen's Green and at a\nlater date hijacked two cars from women shopping at Liffey Valley.\n\nIn another incident he was involved in a 15-minute stand-off with gardai in\nLucan while armed with a knife, and threatening to go into a house and kill the\noccupants. He also violently resisted arrest in Skerries, Co Dublin, where he\nspat at, tried to bite and grabbed the testicles of a garda. He physically\nattacked cops at the Children's Court, and threatened to shoot one in the head.\n\nDefence counsel said Wright faced \"extreme\" difficulties and had very serious\nproblems.\n\nSentencing the terror teen at the time, Judge Michael White considered health\nservice, probation, psychiatric and risk-assessment reports on Wright and\nsuggested he was a \"very high risk of reoffending\".\n\nOne report described Wright as dangerous both to himself and the public, with an\nanger so great it was uncontrollable.\n\nIn 2014, Wright was jailed for four years for stabbing two men in random attacks\nin Dublin city centre in April 2013.\n\nWright had been on bail for assaulting two gardai when he knifed a Mauritian\nnational on Grafton Street and a man walking with a female companion on Chatham\nRow minutes later.\n\nWright, who appeared in court handcuffed and flanked by five prison staff in\nriot gear, told gardai he'd been aiming for the second victim's organs in the\nattack. He claimed he had tried to kill the man, \"but his bird got in the way\".\n\nThe thug, of Teresa's Gardens, Donore Avenue, south inner city Dublin, pleaded\nguilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to attempted robbery and assault of\nHarisikashra Rajaysur outside Burger King, Grafton Street, on April 16, 2013.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to assaulting Killian Byrne and Karolina Dryzaite and to\nrobbing a purse and its contents at Chatham Row on the same date. He also\npleaded guilty to assaulting Garda Denise Bowes and former Reserve Garda Rachel\nFinlay on Abbey Street on January 23, 2013.\n\nSentencing him, Judge Mary Ellen Ring commented that the psychiatrist's report\nmade for \"disturbing reading\".\n\nWhen describing the first attack, Wright had said: \"I just picked a fight with a\nfella and took out a knife and stabbed him.\"\n\nHe said he had been in a \"bad head space\" and under the influence of tablets.\nWright apologised to his victims in later interviews and revealed he had wanted\nto hurt himself as he was sick of life.\n\nIndependent TD Mick Wallace has previously turned up in court to support\nvolatile Wright.\n\nDeputy Wallace and fellow Independent Clare Daly attended a court case in 2016\nin which Wright was cleared of assaulting a prisoner officer.\n\nThe Wexford TD later claimed the notorious prisoner's human rights were being\nviolated. In a statement on his Facebook page Wallace stated: \"People are sent\nto prison as punishment, not for punishment.\"\n\nHe said he was \"motivated by a desire for a safer environment for prisoners,\nstaff and society at large\".\n\n@gmeneely",

New sides of you begin to emerge and secret\nskills are uncovered. In love? A partnership moon opens two hearts to big\nchanges. Single? You'll find a new love interest is an expert in healthy eating.\n\nMake sure you find time for fun in the coming week. As your creativity revs up,\nyour unusual take on the world hits the right audience. Your work ideas are\ngenius - screens and dreams make a perfect match in more ways than one. As the\nplanets of passion and protection join, love finds a future-proof pattern.\n\nWalking on the lighter side of life restores emotional balance, so you'll be\nable to see who could be good for you. This week, power-planet bonds help you to\nreboot tricky partnerships. Meanwhile, your moon path is part \"just do it\", part\ndreamy, so people may not realise your strength until you end up in charge.\n\nYou will build brilliant bonds if you focus on communication. But be sure to\nalways stay true to yourself, so connections begin and stay genuine. Names that\nshare a special date are ready to start an important planning process. Your\nmemory zone is moon-intense and a significant journey is back on.\n\nHiding feelings, even for the best reasons, is not a solution to a problem.\nInstead, follow your heart and find a way to speak about emotions to reset a key\nrelationship. In the next few days, so much of your chart is about finding and\nrewarding value. This helps you overhaul everything, from love bonds to career\naims.\n\nYour chart shows a contrast between high-profile planets in your sign and the\ngentle moon lighting up how you feel and what to do about it - so you're the\ncentre of attention. A leading work role is perfect for you and you learn new\nskills super-fast. In love, going with the flow sets some big feelings free.\n\nStart September with clear decisions about cash, love or time. You have a new\nsense of belief in yourself, and a fresh vision for the future can appear. Luck\nsparkles around words, but you will also find it in how open you are to sharing\nyour dreams with others. In love, pure happiness links to an unexpected L name.\n\nThe people you surround yourself with matter so much right now, and instead of\nwaiting for a family member to call, you should make the first move. At work,\none group can become two and achieve more. A casual bond has the chance to\nbecome serious - but only if you switch off that doubting inner voice.\n\nYour success sector is shining with planet potential and you pursue goals with a\ndeep sense of purpose. Meanwhile, if you've been seeking approval in a\nrelationship, it's time to stop and set your own rules and limits for romance.\nYour Jupiter prize sensors are super-sharp, so you will select contests well.\n\nYour ability to learn in life and love tops all the zodiac signs in the coming\ndays. Intuition gives you a heads-up when making snap decisions or finalising\nkey documents, but best of all you find you won't be held back by the dreams or\nopinions of others. Meanwhile, a name heard several times is your best love\nclue.\n\nWhen you allow yourself to cut loose from tight schedules or expectations, you\nwill make time for something special. And yes, you'll be ready. At the moment\nyour growth and personal change is powered by the planets, which makes you the\nbest version of yourself. Saturn helps you stick to a secret promise.\n\nYou are ready to transform a part-time connection into something that sits\nfirmly in your favour. What may first feel like a problem develops into an\nexciting challenge. Numbers that start with seven and names that remind you of\nholidays are very lucky. Elsewhere, a caring moon leads you to a local charity.",

            "content_plain": "TOMMY WALSH is a \"born winner\" who can halt Dublin's Drive for Five if given the\nchance.\n\nThat is the verdict of his former team-mate and namesake Donnchadh Walsh, who\nhas fancied Kerry to push the Dubs all the way since Peter Keane took over as\nsenior boss.\n\nHe never did get to play under the hugely-successful minor manager, who took\nover from Éamonn Fitzmaurice for the start of the season.\n\nThe 35-year-old retired from he inter-county stage last winter after 15 years of\nsenior service in the green and gold.\n\nBut he admits the players who came in to replace him and fellow retiree Kieran\nDonaghy have improved the team.\n\nThe Cromane man has three Celtic Crosses, eight Munster crowns and two NFL\nDivision 1 titles and there is much he misses about the whole set-up.\n\nHe laughed: \"Not so much the hard training in November and December. But yeah,\non a week like this you would miss a build-up to an All-Ireland final.\"\n\nWalsh forged a reputation as a non-stop running machine, adept at making\nturnovers and then popping up at the other end for crucial scores.\n\nBut injury ravaged the physiotherapist's final season, restricting him to just a\nsubstitute appearance against Galway in the Super 8 loss in Croke Park.\n\nAs he was leaving the panel, he could not help but be enthused about the crop of\nyoung talent coming through the ranks.\n\nBut he reckons that, while Kerry's young rookies will test Dublin today, it\ncould be another veteran who is the key.\n\nWhile flying half-forward Donnchadh left the group, Tommy, 31, returned to the\nKerry panel after 2½ years away.\n\nHe had won an All-Ireland title in 2009 but then departed for the AFL, playing\nwith St Kilda and Sydney Swans before returning to Ireland in 2014.\n\nBut injuries hampered the towering forward's efforts to force his way into\nFitzmaurice's plans and he ultimately left the squad following the 2016 NFL.\n\nBut on the back of a sterling club championship last season with Kerins\nO'Rahillys, Keane called him into the fold.\n\nAnd in the past two games  against Tyrone and Meath  he has had quite the\nimpact.\n\nHis old pal said: \"Seeing Tommy back is just fantastic. It's like a second\ncomeback.\n\n\"He's bringing that bit of seniority to the panel.\n\n\"He's bringing that experience. He's an All-Ireland winner, he's an\nex-professional athlete, and he knows the culture.\n\n\"His father played for Kerry for years, he knows what it means to be a Kerry\nfootballer and he knows what it means to be a Kerry fan because he's been doing\nthat for the last number of years. He'll be a great head in the dressing room.\n\n\"We saw him a lot at the start of the year when the advanced mark rule was\nbrought in for the league.\n\n\"After that we didn't see so much of him and we were kind of wondering what the\nstory was. But in the last two games he has had a huge impact. It's been great\nto see. He is just a fantastic footballer.\n\n\"Getting back in the team won't keep Tommy happy  he is a born winner. He will\nwant to win again with Kerry.\"\n\nFrom the start of the year, Donnchadh has backed Kerry to be there at the\nbusiness end of the season. In January, he suggested they were the only team\ncapable of stopping Dublin.\n\nHe added: \"I always thought Kerry would be the only team that can put it up to\nDublin.\n\n\"I didn't see any of the other teams beating them.\n\n\"But it's very easy to say that. They still have to go out and win it. And that\nwon't be easy. Dublin are an unreal team.\n\n\"I just felt that if anyone was going to stop Dublin doing the five in a row it\ncould be Kerry. While I was in there with them I saw enough of what Kerry could\ndo when they're on form.\n\n\"I don't think  and I include myself in this  what Kerry lost with the\nretirements was irreplaceable. The talent was there to replace the fellas gone,\nif not improve on it.\"\n\nWalsh is still as busy as ever. He was in demand with the media this week,\ntaking part in a GAA NOW show.\n\nEach weekend he travels home to Cromane to represent his club. Still playing\nthere is another ex-Kerry star  the rangy wingforward, Seán O'Sullivan. Walsh\nsays he owes his club a lot and does not mind the travelling.\n\nHe also hailed Keane for building on the excellent culture that Fitzmaurice had\ncreated in the group.\n\nHe said: \"Peter is doing a fine job and I admire him for putting his own stamp\non the squad.\n\n\"There is a huge foundation for any young talented player to absolutely grow and\nmature into a fullyfledged All-Ireland winner. \"Peter has completely freshened\nit up and they have trained hard. That's what was needed, they have just gone at\nit.\"",

We are different.\n\n\"We need to create the legacy for the future.\n\n\"In this period, we are suffering the restrictions but it's normal.\n\n\"The restrictions, OK, we need to work hard to find a way to compete in this\nvery tough league, in a different way to our rivals.\n\n\"Mercedes compete with Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull ... we compete in the same\nrace and if you judge, it needs not only to be about the race but the whole\nprocess.\"\n\nPochettino claims the comparison between his options at centre-forward and what\nArsenal can call on illustrates his point.\n\nThe departure of free agent Fernando Llorente has left Spurs looking a little\nlight up top.\n\nIreland hopeful Troy Parrott looks a sensational prospect but he is still just\n17.\n\nPochettino added: \"Arsenal in the last two years signed Pierre-Emerick\nAubameyang, the best striker in Germany, Alexandre Lacazette, the best striker\nin France and one year after, Pepe. If you see look at fi us over five years, we\nhaven't signed one striker.

I don't want to say one is wrong and\nanother is good.\n\n\"It's only that the way we operate is completely different.\"\n\nTottenham did break their transfer record to sign Lyon midfielder Tanguy\nNdombele in a £65m deal this summer, as well splashing out £25m on Fulham's\n19-year-old winger Ryan Sessegnon.\n\nBut Poch insists the club do not have the money to transform themselves as\nquickly as clubs like Liverpool, who beat them in the Champions League final in\nJune. The Spurs boss the said: \"When Jurgen Klopp arrived in October 2015, more\nthan one year after me, when we drew 0-0 here, not one of their starting XI of\nplayers is there in the starting XI today.\n\n\"And the substitutes are not there. If you compare with us, we have eight or\nnine players still in the starting XI. Look at the difference.\"\n\nPochettino feels Spurs are victims of their own over-achievement, with the 1-0\nhome defeat to Newcastle last Sunday sparking talk of crisis  and even wild\nrumours that he intended to quit after today's game.\n\nYet the Argentine HARRY PAIN ... Spurs star Kane was frustrated after the shock\ndefeat to Newcastle accepts his team's Premier League form  just four wins and\n15 points from their last 15 games  must change.\n\nHe added: \"The problem we had is we were so good in our results and\nperformances, that we didn't start in the way we'd expect or people would\nexpect.\n\n\"That led to, 'Big problem' and 'Pochettino is going to walk away' and this type\nof situation that someone with no common sense created.\"\n\n\"In the Premier League over the last six months, I think it was not great. We\nneed to try to find the way to improve our results.\n\n\"Yes, of course it wasn't the best performance against Newcastle but there was\nenough there to draw or win the game.\n\n\"But when the result is negative you lose all the reason and you cannot reverse\nthe opinion or perception.\n\n\"For me, I am not worried about our performance because we have a very good team\nand I am optimistic and positive.\"",

Cops confirmed one\nfan was arrested for affray and an investigation has been launched into the\nchaotic scenes.\n\nLansbury's goal was ruled out because Friend had already blown for diving\nagainst Grealish inside the penalty box.\n\nA possible penalty for Villa was checked by VAR official Andrew Madley but\nFriend's original decision of a free-kick to Palace stood because there was no\nobvious error.\n\nAll that led to Villa boss Dean Smith blasting Friend and VAR, while midfielder\nJohn McGinn claimed his team had been \"robbed\".\n\nSmith said: \"It was a good goal. No one could understand why it wasn't given.\nMayhem ensued.\n\n\"I spoke in the week about VAR and subjective decisions but the system is meant\nto right wrongs.\n\n\"I wondered what I'd be like when that system went against me.\"\n\nSmith said he was hoping to speak to Friend  who also sent off Trezeguet \nbefore leaving London.\n\nHe added: \"I didn't understand the officials' decision-making today. If you're\nJack Grealish, you'd be raging. He's had his integrity questioned.\"\n\nMatch report  Goals Page 7",

This victory at Turf Moor was a club-record 13th\nleague win in a row, topping the mark set by Kenny Dalglish's side in 1990  the\nyear they last won the title.\n\nYou have to wonder what sort of new mark this team might set.\n\nGood luck Newcastle, who are next up at Anfield after the international break.\n\nNowadays Liverpool just beat Burnley and Manchester City just beat Brighton.\nLiverpool will no doubt beat Newcastle  that's just how it is.\n\nAnd that is how it will continue to be for the foreseeable future at this rate.\n\nThey are that much better than the rest  and the Premier League table is\nalready showing it.\n\nLiverpool must still wonder how on earth 97 points was not enough to end that\nlong title quest last season.\n\nThe small matter of City were in their way, the small margin of a point\nseparated them.\n\nThere were obvious questions at the beginning of the season whether or not\nLiverpool could go again after that mammoth effort in the league and in Europe.\n\nBut those doubts have very quickly been answered  the appetite remains the\nsame.\n\nIt is four wins from four and a two-point lead over City.\n\nAs you would expect, Burnley had a good go.\n\nIndeed, they had the first chance when after two minutes Chris Wood turned\ninside Uefa Player of the Year Virgil van Dijk  not words you hear very often.\n\nWith space gained, his shot was then well placed towards the far bottom corner\nbut Adrian, looking for his first clean sheet in the Liverpool goal, dived full\nlength to palm it away.\n\nQuickly, though, Liverpool set up camp in Burnley's half, with Mo Salah twice\ngoing desperately close to scoring.\n\nHe rattled the post with a shot after five minutes then, after linking up with\nJordan Henderson, saw his shot hit keeper Nick Pope and rebound back off his own\nknee before going wide.\n\nThe breakthrough came on 33 minutes when Trent Alexander- Arnold tried to curl\nin a cross from outside the area.\n\nThe ball did not go to its intended far-post target.\n\nInstead, it clipped the back of Clarets striker Wood in front of him and spun up\nand over the stranded and unfortunate Pope.\n\nThink Ronaldinho against England at the 2002 World Cup ... with a bit of help.\n\nIf that was unlucky the next goal four minutes later was downright careless on\nthe part of Burnley captain Ben Mee.\n\nHis terrible loose pass straight to Roberto Firmino gave away possession 15\nyards inside the home half.\n\nIt was not even near to one of his team-mates and within seconds he paid the\nprice as Firmino sprinted away and fed Sadio Mane to his left, who then stroked\na shot into the far corner.\n\nThe third in the 80th minute saw Firmino became the first Brazilian in Premier\nLeague history to reach 50 goals.\n\nIt came thanks to the industry of Salah, who made up for not setting his pal up\nearlier when he was free.\n\nFull of running, the Egyptian chased a ball down to the side of the Burnley box\nand forced it across to Firmino just outside the area. His finish into the\nbottom left-hand corner was clinical.\n\nJob well and truly done for Jurgen Klopp's men.\n\nBurnley ended up huffing and puffing but Liverpool looked like they could have\nplayed again. They pass the ball through and around you. They hound you down,\nnick the ball and race away.\n\nIf you make a mistake you pay the price. Give them an opening and they will find\nit. They can mix it up, too. They can stand up to anything thrown at them.\n\nSo into the international break with the top of the Premier League table taking\non a very familiar look.\n\nIt is early days, and there is a long way to go, but already another\nblow-for-blow epic between Liverpool and City is on the cards.\n\nAlready we wonder who might get the other two places in the top four.\n\nBecause if anything the gap between these two and the rest looks even wider than\nlast season.\n\nTweet @ncustisTheSun\n\nPW D L F APts Liverpool ......... 4 4 0 0 12 3 12 Man City...........4 3 1 0 14\n3 10 Leicester..........4 2 2 0 6 3 8 CrystalPalace.4 2 1 1 3 2 7 West\nHam........4 2 1 1 6 7 7 Arsenal............3 2 0 1 4 4 6 Man Utd ........... 4\n1 2 1 7 4 5 Sheff Utd.........4 1 2 1 5 5 5 Chelsea............4 1 2 1 6 9 5\nTottenham .....3 1 1 1 5 4 4 Burnley............4 1 1 2 5 6 4\nEverton............3 1 1 1 1 2 4 Southampton.4 1 1 2 4 6 4 Newcastle.......4 1 1\n2 3 5 4 Bournemouth.4 1 1 2 5 8 4 Brighton..........4 1 1 2 4 7 4\nWolves.............3 0 3 0 2 2 3 Aston Villa.......4 1 0 3 4 6 3\nNorwich...........4 1 0 3 6 10 3 Watford...........4 0 1 3 2 8 1 PREM TABLE",

            "content_plain": "ONE night at Dublin training in 2002, the late, great Dave Billings said\nsomething daft.\n\nBlues goalkeeper Davy Byrne had just retired from intercounty football and a\n20-yearold Stephen Cluxton was parachuted in as their new No 1. Billings  who\npassed away four years ago  was a selector under Tommy Lyons at the time.\n\nAnd he looked on as their freshfaced stopper was practising his kickouts in a\nmost peculiar way.\n\nCluxton wanted a target, so he decided to place the ball on the 45-metre line\nand aim for goal.\n\nKeen to work on his catching, defender Paddy Christie stood behind the posts and\nleapt at the balls the Parnells youngster was pinging over the crossbar.\n\nIn passing, Billings suggested 'Clucko' should hit the Dublin 45s.\n\nChristie said he was mad and thought no more of it.\n\nLittle did they know, they were watching the man who would transform the game\nforever.\n\nThe schoolteacher has since taught us how the role of the goalkeeper can have\nsuch a bigger impact than was ever envisaged.\n\nNine years on from that training session, Dublin faced Kerry in the All-Ireland\nfinal. In the dying moments they won a free just inside the 45m line facing Hill\n16.\n\nBernard Brogan did not fancy it and up came the keeper.\n\nHe planted it over the bar to seal a 1-12 to 1-11 win as the Dubs ended a\n16-year famine.\n\nNow they are chasing their fifth All-Ireland title in a row today against the\nKingdom  and captain Clucko's kickouts have been the launch-pad for all of that\nsuccess.\n\nDaft? Not a bit of it. Christie told SunSport: \"Dave Billings, God rest him, was\na selector with Tommy Lyons.\n\n\"Clucko was practicing kickouts and he used to kick 45s because it gave him a\ntarget to hit rather than hitting into an empty space.\n\nVISIONARY great \"I always wanted to work on catching high ball at the edge of\nthe square so I used to stand behind the goal a lot of the time to catch the\nballs that Cluxton was kicking in.\n\n\"One day when Cluxton was kicking the 45s over the bar, Billings said 'It might\nnot be a bad idea to bring him up for 45s'.\n\n\"That was in 2002 and before he started doing these short kickouts. I didn't pay\nany heed to Billo at the time because it was a crazy idea and it just wasn't\ndone.\n\n\"I took one against Donegal and one against Armagh in the semi-final that year,\nand even that was considered a bit iffy because I wasn't a forward. The refs\nweren't happy about it either because it was considered time-wasting.\n\n\"Then in 2011, he goes and does it with that final kick and the rest is history.\nI often wondered had I listened to Dave and tried to push it a bit, would it\nhave made a difference.\n\n\"But it was just considered ... the late, Dave Billings crazy because nobody did\nthat. It was a visionary from Dave and eventually Pat Gilroy went for it.\"\n\nChristie made his SFC debut for the Dubs in 1997 and was a fans' favourite by\nthe time Cluxton arrived into the squad in 2001.\n\nThe Ballymun defender was always first at training and football was the dominant\nforce in his life.\n\nBut his own dedication was soon eclipsed by the young stopper who is still\nraising standards 18 years later.\n\nAll those hours on the training field are why Cluxton has six All-Ireland medals\nand will go down as the greatest keeper of them all.\n\nChristie said: \"He was phenomenal. For a fella of his age at the time, his\nprofessionalism and the way he went about things and his attitude to training\nwas hard to beat.\n\n\"I would have always prided myself personally on giving a lot to training and\nmatches and being well-prepared, because football was No 1 in my life.\n\n\"I was always down as one of the first to turn up for training.\n\n\"But often I wasn't the first because it was Stephen.\n\n\"He was so young, and for this guy to be at the forefront at training and show\nthat sort of dedication was very impressive.\n\n\"He's got such nerve, and for a fella who isn't that big he's got a serious\nstrike. That's all to do with his technique and the amount of practice he puts\nin from turning up so early for training every night.\"\n\nChristie retired from inter-county football in 2007 and is one of those Hill 16\nheroes who never got his hands on Sam.\n\nDublin were a hard-luck story in those years and were always the bridesmaid as\nKerry, Galway, Meath Armagh and Tyrone bagged titles.\n\nNow game-changer Cluxton is the only member of Gavin's squad left from when\nChristie was in the dressing room.\n\nThey are chasing history today against the Kingdom and could go where no team\nhas gone before.\n\nAnd the 2002 All-Star winner stressed that Cluxton's beauty back in 2011 was the\nspark that lit the flame.\n\nHe said: \"They are going for five in a row now but that 2011 final was a big\nturning point because it looked like they were going to lose.\n\n\"If Cluxton hadn't kicked that over, Kerry always had the Indian sign over us\nand they probably would have maybe won that day, or even won a replay.\n\n\"But that win changed everything, and without him it wouldn't have happened.\n\n\"I always take pleasure in watching what he has achieved over the years.\n\n\"He's a phenomenon, and he deserves everything he gets.\"\n\nGORDON MANNING KERRY'S hope is that Dublin's full-back line can be got at. But\nthat's all it is, hope.\n\nWe have already seen this year that the Kingdom's defence can be got at.\n\nKerry need a huge display from David Moran and David Clifford.\n\nThey need Dublin to have an off day for 70-odd minutes. But that hasn't happened\nin five years now.\n\nAll Kerry really have is a hope that it might today.\n\nVERDICT: Dublin JASON BYRNE JIM GAVIN'S Dublin have huge pressure on them to\ndeliver but there is nothing to suggest they will bottle this now.\n\nKerry's David Clifford was born to play on days like these but he'll have to\nwait for his first senior medal.\n\nDublin have drowned out all of the noise that goes with chasing history  now it\nis time to seal the five in a row.\n\nVERDICT: Dublin PAUL KEANE YOU mightn't have noticed but none of the Dublin subs\nthat came on against Mayo in the semi-final managed to score.\n\nIt was only the second time that happened in Jim Gavin's 46 Championship games\nin charge  and a repeat is unlikely.\n\nThe Dubs have always used supersubs as their battering ram to famous wins.\nHistory will finally be made today and Dublin's awesome bench will finish the\njob for them.\n\nVERDICT: Dublin COLLIE MORAN PETER KEANE'S Kerry will need at least two goals,\nand probably three, to beat Dublin.\n\nBut they have only averaged one goal per game in this year's Championship.\n\nThere is a risk for the Kingdom that the Dubs could put up a high score at the\nother end.\n\nIf Jim Gavin's side get a run on Kerry's young players then Croke Park could be\na very lonely place to be. Dublin by eight points or more.\n\nVERDICT: Dublin GRAHAM GERAGHTY DUBLIN are so close to the five in a row they\ncan touch it.\n\nNow it's just a case of how much are they going to win by because I don't give\nKerry a chance at all.\n\nIt will be five in a row and possibly a lot more. I can't see who can stop them\nin 2020 either.\n\nKerry will try and play football but that will open things up and fall into\nDublin's favour.\n\nVERDICT: Dublin DAMIAN LAWLOR THE GAA romantic in me is screaming that there is\nan upset on the cards here, that Kerry could force a last-minute draw, maybe\neven an unlikely win.\n\nBut the road-weary scribe in me simply cannot dismiss the quality, tempo,\npatience, versatility, reserves and downright brilliance that Dublin can summon.\n\nThey won't have it all their own way but they will find a way.\n\nVERDICT: Dublin The drive for five \"I JUST can't see Dublin being beaten. I\ndon't see it as being a cakewalk or a walk in the park, I just think they have\ntoo much in their armoury.\n\n\"The main reasons being I think the Dublin forward line ... people are saying\nKerry's attack are just as strong, but I'm not sure just yet.\n\n\"There are fellas on the Dublin bench who would be central players on most other\ninter-county teams and they'll just have too much.\"\n\nPlaying with Jim Gavin \"BACK in the late 90s we were after playing a match and\nhe took a banana out of his gear bag. He was ridiculed. The lads were laughing\nat him because they were going for a piss-up.\n\n\"He was always very organised and dedicated as a player.\n\nBeing honest about it, he wasn't one of the better footballers in the group but\nhe took what he had and used it.\n\n\"He was small, wasn't the best in the air and he had a lot of different things\ngoing against him but made a niche for himself as a defensive wing-forward and\nworked extremely hard.\"\n\nDiarmuid Connolly \"DIARMUID will only feature today if there's an emergency. It\nwould be hard on the other forwards on the bench and Jim thinks of the future\nall the time.\n\n\"That's why they are what they are. If Jim was a short-term guy, they wouldn't\nbe going for five All-Irelands in a row.\n\n\"It's attractive to bring someone of that quality on but in the long-term it\ncould do damage and make lads unhappy, so it could be a last resort. But if they\nwere two points behind with 10 minutes to go, it would be crazy not to bring\nhim.\"\n\nThis Kerry team \"DEFENSIVELY Kerry will need to tighten up a lot, because Cathal\nMcShane did a lot of damage against them in the semi-final against Tyrone.\n\n\"If Con O'Callaghan gets that same sort of room and freedom in the final, I\ncan't see them getting near Dublin.\n\n\"They need to over-perform and Dublin to under-perform for them to win.\"\n\nTURNING POINT ... Cluxton's famous point in the 2011 final was launchpad for\nDublin",

            "content_plain": "W l d it IN the final 16 minutes here, Wales scored 14 points without reply.\n\nThey may not be as numerous but there are still plenty of unanswered questions\nfor Joe Schmidt.\n\nThis was better from Ireland compared to the display against England but, then,\nit came against a muchinferior side, with Warren Gatland having made 14 changes\nfor his last home game as Wales coach.\n\nSo figuring out what weighting to attach to each display, previous performances,\nform in training, physical condition, versatility and overall balance of the\nsquad are all things which Schmidt must factor in when trying to decide which 31\nplayers to bring to Japan.\n\nHe has done this once before but he is not sure he got it right and so is wary\nof jumping to conclusions on the basis of what he saw here.\n\nSchmidt said: \"Will Addison did some things really well.\n\n\"He got a cut which was superficial and then got a little bit of cramp.\n\n\"Because he hadn't played in so long, we decided to take him off so he didn't\ndevelop any injury as a result of his calf cramping up. He's got such a balanced\nrunning style, he gets a good look at the pitch when he's running back to\nfull-back.\n\n\"He's accomplished at kicking and he's accomplished at kicking at goal.\n\n\"He's a bit underdone, he hasn't got as much rugby as we would like because he\nhasn't played much this year, he missed the Six Nations.\n\n\"But his versatility is a huge asset in general.\n\n\"He can play on the wing because he's got high speed, he obviously stepped in\nvery late to play 13 against Argentina last year.\n\n\"So he can cover the full spectrum of the back three and 13.\n\n\"That's an asset when you're trying to narrow the squad down.\n\n\"So we're looking at him and trying to compare him to the other guys to see how\nthey best fit the mould and I'll tell you now, I'm not sure.\n\n\"Whatever you do, there's always a risk you don't get it quite right.\n\n\"I don't think we quite got it right last time. Some times in retrospect is the\nonly time you know, 'Did I get that right or not?' \"Going forward, you're\npredicting as best you can, trying to ensure they're in the best physical\ncondition and ready to go.\n\n\"But you don't really know until you get out there and are in the thick of it\nreally.\"\n\nStill, at the very least it can be said that Ulster man Addison did his chances\nno harm.\n\nLikewise for Jack Carty at out-half, even if his task was considerably easier\nthan that which rival Ross Byrne had against England.\n\nThe smart money would be on Connacht man Carty getting the nod behind Johnny\nSexton  who should start against Wales next Saturday  and Joey Carbery, who\nmay be on the bench and should be fully ready for the opener against Scotland.\n\nSchmidt said: \"He's done well but it's apples, oranges and lemons.\n\n\"We've got different options at 10, one who hasn't played yet at all but we know\nhe'll play next week and another who I thought had 50 superb minutes against\nItaly.\n\n\"He's currently injured but he might be back on the bench next week, or he'll\ncertainly be back against Scotland. Jack has done well. I think Ross was unlucky\nbecause he had tired legs and front-foot ball and the space that Jack got but\nJack made the most of it.\"\n\nCarty, starting a Test match for the first time, settled his nerves with a\nninth-minute penalty.\n\nJarrod Evans levelled matters after an infringement by Ireland captain Peter\nO'Mahony but, thereafter, the visitors took control.\n\nAfter a good take in the air by Addison, and a strong carry by David Kilcoyne,\nCarty offloaded to Andrew Conway, who made use of Chris Farrell's support as a\ndecoy before picking out Jacob Stockdale to touch down in the corner.\n\nStockdale grabbed a second when he pounced on Aaron Shingler's loose pass,\nkicking the ball ahead of Owen Lane before collecting it ahead of Hallam Amos.\n\nCarty converted the first but not the second with Stockdale withdrawn at the\ninterval after a confidencebuilding 40 minutes.\n\nNext, it was the turn of Ireland's pack to get a lift.\n\nFive scrum penalties in a row saw Leon Brown yellow-carded and, later, a penalty\ntry awarded to stretch their advantage to 19 points.\n\nIn particular, Dave Kilcoyne and replacement Andrew Porter will feel that their\nperformances should help ensure they will not be the recipients of bad news.\n\nThere were further chances but two other scores were disallowed as Carty's pass\nto Conway was forward and Bundee Aki was penalised for tackling in the air in\nthe build-up to Garry Ringrose touching down.\n\nAnd Wales' late pressure was rewarded with two converted tries from Owen Lane\nand Rhys Patchell to ensure there were only five points between the sides at the\nend.\n\nSchmidt said: \"We know that we created lot of angst outside our environment with\nhow we played against England.\n\n\"We knew how hard we would be worked, we knew we were vulnerable, but it was\nstill unacceptable to fall off the number of tackles and be as far behind in the\ngame as we were.\n\n\"We've restored a bit of self-confidence as much as anything.\" And pride,\naccording to O'Mahony, one of just four survivors in the starting XV.\n\nThe Munster flanker said: \"From the players' point of view, it's been a long\nweek.\n\n\"Guys were itching to get out there and we left the jersey in a better place\nthan certainly last week.\"\n\nWALES: Amos, Lane, Williams, Watkin, S Evans (Homes 48), J Evans (Patchell 41),\nA Davies (T Williams 48); Carre (R Evans 41), Elias (Dee 63), Lee (Brown 41),\nBeard, B Davies (Ball 48), Shingler (Wainwright 63), J Davies (Lee 52-62),\nNavidi.

I doubt I will get there at 36. It\nwould be nice but I do not think it will happen. When you are young you do not\nworry too much because you will get another one.\n\n\"But as one of the senior guys I have to make sure that everyone pushes because\nthere is no tomorrow in some regard.\n\n\"This is the best squad I have been with in terms of tightness.\n\n\"In the last World Cup it was too individual, but now everyone is pushing each\nother and working hard. There is a togetherness.\n\n\"The squad was announced early, which gives you some confidence, but there is\nstill a lot of work to do ahead of Japan.\"\n\nHead coach Eddie Jones has gambled by picking only two tighthead props  Cole\nand Kyle Sinckler  in his 31-man squad.\n\nCole added: \"We have a four-day turnaround and then a longer one. You want to\nplay, not make up the numbers.\"",

            "content_plain": "Have you ever sneezed and felt some pee come out? How about when doing a star\njump? Let's not mention the time you took the kids to the trampoline park. The\nunspoken truth is that many women of all ages are secretly dealing with leaks\ncaused by a weak pelvic floor.\n\n\"Stats show urinary incontinence affects one in three women, but I suspect the\nnumbers are much higher,\" says Jane Simpson, a continence specialist and author\nof The Pelvic Floor Bible. \"People have busy lives so they just find ways around\nit, like wearing a pad when working out, but we shouldn't accept that.\"\n\nThe pelvic floor is a group of muscles that work like a sling, keeping your\nlower organs in place. It's crucial for helping you control bodily functions\nsuch as going to the loo, and even helps with orgasms, which involve a rapid\ncontraction of the superficial pelvic floor muscles.\n\n\"Plenty of factors can weaken the pelvic floor muscles, including pregnancy,\nchildbirth, menopause and high-impact sport,\" explains Jane. The good news is\nthat these muscles can be strengthened with exercises at home in just five\nminutes or less a day. Sounds like our kind of workout!\n\nTEST YOUR STRENGTH \n\nA simple way to see if you've got control of your pelvic floor muscles is to try\nto stop the flow of urine midstream. \"This is recommended as a test, not an\nexercise, as it's bad for your bladder to keep stopping and starting,\" warns\nJane. \"If you succeed, your muscles are engaging, although they may still need\nstrengthening. Alternatively, insert a finger and see if you can squeeze it, or\ntry tensing around your partner's penis during sex.\n\nIf you feel a dragging sensation or heaviness, you may have a prolapse, where\nthe pelvic floor isn't supporting your organs well enough.\"\n\nSTART EARLY \n\nLeaks are no fun and having a prolapse can be tough, so prevention is key.\n\"Younger women are increasingly doing high-intensity exercises such as HIIT,\nwhich put huge stress on the pelvic floor,\" says Jane. \"More women are also\nhaving their first baby when they're older, which studies show increases their\nlikelihood of major pelvic floor injuries during birth.\" Research has found that\npelvic floor exercises before conceiving or in the early stages of pregnancy\nhelps prevent bladder weakness in the future.* You'll definitely thank yourself\nlater.\n\nFIVE-MINUTE WORKOUT \n\nMost of us exercise the rest of our body regularly (well, ish) and clean our\nteeth every day, but because our pelvic floor is out of sight, we tend to ignore\nit - even when it's behaving badly. \"Like any muscle, the key to keeping it\nworking well is to repeatedly contract and release it through exercise,\" says\nRosie Stockley, personal trainer and founder of Mamawell, which specialises in\npre- and post-natal fitness. She suggests trying this daily five-minute quick\nfix: 1 Sit on a chair with your feet on the floor or lie on your back with your\nknees bent.\n\n2 Take three deep breaths to relax - you don't want to be holding in your tummy.\n\n3 Pretend you're trying to stop a wee, while at the same time trying not to\nfart. Make sure you're not squeezing your buttocks.\n\n4 Hold for 10 seconds while breathing normally. 5 Let everything go and take a\ndeep breath before tensing again.\n\n6 Repeat 10 times. If you've recently had a baby, try this at least twice a day.\n\n'APPY SQUEEZING \n\nFinding it hard to remember to do those exercises? There's an app for that.\n\"Giving my younger clients a piece of paper with exercises on rarely works, but\ntech has been shown to be helpful in forming regular habits,\" says Jane. Squeezy\n(£2.99) is recommended by the NHS and is designed by women's health specialists.\nIt has guided pelvic floor exercises with regular reminders to do them, and it\neven bleeps during the routines so you know you're doing them for long enough.\nYou can also customise your workout and track your progress.\n\nPT FOR YOUR PF \n\nAt £169 it may be spenny, but if you want a high-tech personal coach for your\nlady regions try the Elvie Trainer. This kit has a silicone wand that you insert\nwith the tail remaining outside (like a tampon), before it connects via\nBluetooth to an app on your phone that will guide you through a series of\nfive-minute exercises. It can also track your symptoms and progress. There are\nfour levels to try and you can set goals and schedule reminders. \"Always read\nthe manufacturer's instructions or ask your GP first,\" advises Rosie. \"You can't\nuse it if pregnant or if you've had cancerous cells in the cervix.\"\n\nGAME OF CONES \n\nVaginal cones are small weights made from silicone or plastic-coated metal that\ncan be used to help train your pelvic floor muscles. \"They're not good if you've\ngot a prolapse, so speak to your GP or a women's health specialist,\" warns Jane.\nKegal8 vaginal cones, £34.99, are a similar shape to a tampon, and once you've\ninserted one, you contract your pelvic floor muscles to stop it from slipping\nout. They come in different weights (usually 5-20g) and you can increase the\nweight as your muscles strengthen over time. Always follow instructions\ncarefully.\n\nBUILD IT UP \n\nGetting back into exercise is daunting, but if you've just had a baby there's an\nextra obstacle to worry about. \"No matter how sporty you were before, always\nfocus on your pelvic floor first,\" says Rosie, who recommends building exercise\nup slowly. Start with running for one minute then briskly walking for one\nminute. In that time, consider whether your pelvic floor feels heavy. If not,\nrun for one more minute. If you experience leaking or heaviness, stop and use\nthe time to exercise your pelvic floor again. Try to do one minute of pelvic\nfloor exercises before you start in order to get those muscles working. When\ndoing high-intensity exercise, don't contract your pelvic floor constantly as\nit'll put the muscles under too much strain.\n\nSEE A PHYSIO \n\n\"If after three to six months of daily exercise you can't feel any difference,\nsee a women's health physiotherapist,\" says Jane. \"They can offer treatments\nsuch as biostimulation using electrodes in the vagina, and advise on advanced\nexercises.\" Ask your GP about referring you to an NHS physio. F TA M P O N TRICK\nAn exercise hack if you're a tampon user is to insert one and pull gently on the\nstring whilst at the same time trying to contract your muscles to stop it coming\nout - a bit like a tug of war.\n\nKEEP REGULAR Around 50% of people with chronic constipation suffer pelvic floor\nproblems. You can keep things moving by upping your fibre (by eating foods such\nas wholegrains), drinking plenty of fluids and doing regular exercise.\n\n'Prevent prolapse with pelvic exercises'",

That'll be thanks to the lactic acid, which gently\nexfoliates skin, as well as anti-inflammatory allantoin, which helps soothe\nsensitivity.\n\nCHRISSY NOSE BEST In true Chrissy Teigen form, the model, TV presenter, celeb\nchef and all-round social media star took to Instagram to share her love for\nBioré Ultra Deep Cleansing Pore Strips, £8.99 for six. Tea tree oil, menthol and\nwitch hazel get to work to clear congested pores and banish blackheads. The\nqueen of real talk even admits to examining the strips after, too. Gross, but so\nrelatable.\n\nCARA'S SMOOTH OPERATOR Minimise the appearance of scars, fine lines and wrinkles\nwith Cara Delevingne's go-to skin smoothing hero, Trilogy Certified Organic\nRosehip Oil, £19.50. The actress and supermodel uses it twice a day on her face,\nbut the wonder oil, which is packed with essential fatty acids including omegas\n3, 6 and 9, can be used all over the body and even helps repair damaged hair.\nAnd because of its super-fine, non-comedogenic formula, it's great for all skin\ntypes, whether you're trying to combat dryness, stretch marks or acne.\n\nBRONZE 'CHELLE Not ready to ditch the contour just yet? When actress Michelle\nKeegan says she can't see herself moving on from the trend any time soon, you\nknow you can relax. Sweep Benefit Hoola Bronzer, £26, under your cheekbones, jaw\nand in the socket of your eyes to add dimension to your features. The Our Girl\nstar has been using the cult classic since she worked on a Benefit counter way\nbefore she made it on to our screens.\n\nDREW'S GO-TO 'POO It's not all salon visits and blow-dries for this Charlie's\nAngel. Self-confessed dry shampoo enthusiast Drew Barrymore loves Batiste Dry\nShampoo, £2.99, claiming it's \"better than any I have ever tried\", and that it\n\"actually does what it promises to do\", from adding texture to absorbing excess\noil. She even keeps a mini can in her bag for on-the-go top-ups - our kinda\ngirl!\n\nBALM IT LIKE BECKHAM Suffer from dry, patchy skin? Do as Victoria Beckham does\nand keep a tube of Weleda Skin Food, £7.95, in your handbag. The designer is\nobsessed with the thick, buttery formula and claims to use it over her entire\nbody. Other fans of the 100% natural balm include Adele, Rosie\nHuntington-Whiteley and Alexa Chung - as if you needed any more convincing.\n\nEM'S MAGIC MARKER We love a good multitasker, and it seems Harry Potter star\nEmma Watson does, too. She revealed she reaches for The Body Shop Lip & Cheek\nStain in Red Pomegranate, £8, every day to add a bit of colour to her face and\nstop her looking washed out without masking her freckles. It's enriched with\nsoothing aloe vera and glycerine to help prevent chapped lips and give cheeks a\nsubtle rosy glow. According to the actress: \"You can kiss someone while you're\nwearing it and it's not going to come off.\" Who are we to argue? F",

New sides of you begin to emerge and\nsecret skills are uncovered. In love? A partnership moon opens two hearts at the\nsame time to big changes. Single? You'll find a new love interest is an expert\nin healthy eating.\n\nGEMINI \n\nMAY 22 - JUNE 21 \n\nWalking on the lighter side of life can restore emotional balance, which means\nyou'll be able to see who could be good for you. This week, big power-planet\nbonds in your personal headspace zone help you reboot tricky connections.\nMeanwhile, your moon-path is part \"just do it\", part dreamy, so people may not\nrealise how strong you are until you end up in charge.\n\nLEO \n\nJULY 23 - AUG 23 \n\nHiding your real feelings even for the best reasons is not a good solution to a\nproblem. Instead, follow your heart and find a way to speak about your emotions\nto reset a key relationship. This week, so much of your chart is about value:\nfinding it and rewarding it. This helps you overhaul everything, from love bonds\nto long-term career ambitions.\n\nCAPRICORN \n\nDEC 22 - JAN 20 \n\nYour ability to learn in life and love tops all of the zodiac signs this week.\nThis intuition gives you a heads-up when making snap decisions or finalising key\ndocuments, but best of all you'll find you won't be held back by other people's\ndreams or opinions. Meanwhile, a name you've heard several times lately is your\nbest-ever love clue.\n\nLIBRA \n\nSEPT 23 - OCT 23 \n\nStart this month off with clear decisions about cash, love or time. Now you have\na new sense of belief in yourself, a fresh vision for your future can appear.\nLuck sparkles around words you write and read, but you'll also find it in how\nopen you are to sharing your dreams with others. In love, pure happiness links\nto an unexpected \"L\" name.\n\nAQUARIUS \n\nJAN 21 - FEB 18 \n\nWhen you allow yourself to cut loose from tight schedules or expectations,\nyou'll make time for something special - and yes, you'll be ready. This week,\nyour chart of growth and personal change is powered by the planets, which makes\nyou become the best version of yourself. Elsewhere, Saturn's steady support\nhelps you stick to a secret promise.\n\nSCORPIO \n\nOCT 24 - NOV 22 \n\nThe people you surround yourself with matter so much right now, and instead of\nwaiting for a member of your family to call, you should make the first move. At\nwork, one group can become two and achieve more as a result. A casual bond has\nthe chance to grow into something serious - but only if you switch off the\ndoubting voice in your heart and mind.\n\nPISCES \n\nFEB 19 - MAR 20 \n\nYou're ready to transform a part-time connection or contract into something that\nsits firmly in your favour. This week, what may feel like a problem at first\nthen develops into an such an exciting challenge. Numbers that start with seven\nand names that remind you of holidays are very lucky.\n\nElsewhere, a caring moon leads you to a local charity group.\n\nTAURUS \n\nAPR 21 - MAY 21 \n\nMake sure you find time for fun this week. As your creativity revs up, you'll\nfind that your unusual take on the world will reach the right audience.\nElsewhere, your work ideas are pure genius.\n\nScreens and dreams make a perfect match in more ways than one. As the planets of\npassion and protection join forces, love settles into a future-proof pattern.\n\nCANCER \n\nJUNE 22 - JULY 22 \n\nYou'll build brilliant bonds in the next few days if you focus on communication.\nBut be sure to always stay true to yourself, so connections begin - and stay -\ngenuine. Names that share a special date are ready to start an important\nplanning process. Your memory zone is moonintense and a significant journey is\nback on.\n\nSAGITTARIUS \n\nNOV 23 - DEC 21 \n\nThis week, your success sector shines bright with planet potential and you\npursue your goals with a deep sense of purpose. Meanwhile, if you've been\nseeking approval in a relationship, it's time to stop and set your own rules and\nlimits for romance. Your Jupiter prize sensors are super-sharp, so you'll select\ncontests well.\n\nPHONE MEG'S LIVE PSYCHICS ON 0905 005 8102 OR TO PAY BY CREDIT/DEBIT CARD CALL\n08000 356 684 OR MOBILE USERS CALL 020 7111 6406 TEXT A PSYCHIC.

            "content_plain": "During a girls' holiday in Italy last year my friend Delia, 30, announced: \"I\nlove my body. It's not perfect, but I finally like what I see in the mirror.\"\n\n\" I smiled meekly in response. Of course I was happy for her, but I felt a\nlittle jealous. For as long as I could remember I'd been reading life-coaching\nbooks, following countless empowering Instagram accounts and dieting in the hope\nof falling in love with my figure, but it never happened. No matter how hard I\ntried, I couldn't relate. When I looked in the mirror, instead of loving what\nwas in front of me, all I saw was thick thighs and wide hips.\n\nHowever, this June I came across an article about body neutrality, which changed\nmy perspective. The trend refers to simply accepting your shape as it is without\nlove or hate, and acknowledging what your body does for you. Reading it, I\nfinally found a realistic approach to changing the way I saw myself.\n\nMy journey to self-acceptance has been rocky. Going to an all-girls' school in\nSouth Wales, I became very aware of my appearance in my early teens. Comparison\nwas my worst enemy, and when my hips and breasts started to develop I felt dumpy\nnext to my slim friends. Naively, I believed that I wouldn't be happy until I\nlost weight, so in January 2005, aged 15, I drastically cut down on calories and\nwith my parents' blessing joined a gym, working out three times a week. Soon my\njeans felt baggier and my legs were slimmer, and I was thrilled. But my\nlow-calorie diet wasn't healthy or sustainable, so when I switched back to\neating normally the pounds crept back on and I hated my body once more.\n\nI spent the next 10 years yo-yo dieting and at 25 weighed 9st 7lb, which was\nhealthy for my 5ft 7in height. My friends commented on how great I looked and\nwhile I knew I wasn't overweight, I never felt content - there was always an\narea to tone or an imperfection to fix. When I saw other women celebrating their\nbodies, I felt like a failure. Why couldn't I be that happy? I'm not the only\none who feels this way. A recent survey found that one in five UK adults feel\nshame about their bodies, while 19% say they're disgusted by what they see in\nthe mirror.* With so many of us struggling to find peace, loving your body can\nfeel like a mountain to climb, so it's no surprise that the neutrality movement,\nwhich started in America and began popping up on social media in 2015, has\nbecome so popular. Helena Lewis, psychotherapist and founder of On Route Health,\nalso prefers this new trend. \"Culturally, we have moved away from valuing the\nfunctionality of our body and the focus has been on image,\" she says. \"For\npeople who are caught up in what feels like a constant battle against\nself-hatred, changing their mindset to celebrate every part of their body may\nseem impossible. Body neutrality teaches us that you might not love every single\npatch of cellulite and belly roll, but you should accept them and not punish\nyourself for it.\"\n\nEmbracing body neutrality hasn't been easy. I knew I couldn't spend my life\ntrying to \"improve\", so after reading that article I decided to focus on what my\nbody has done for me and not on how it looks. For example, rather than feeling\nbad about my thighs, I thought about how amazing they were to have carried me\nthrough a half-marathon three years ago. It was a struggle at first, and I've\noften had to force myself to ignore negative thoughts. Just last month when I\nwas getting ready for a night out I felt insecure about how I looked, but\nfocused instead on the fact my body allows me to go for it on the dance floor.\nSo I put on a killer outfit, enjoyed a glass of wine and had a laugh with my\nmates.\n\nThe pessimistic thoughts have gradually quietened down, and now when I catch my\nreflection in a mirror I feel OK instead of rubbish. By focusing less on my\nimage, I was able to relax my exercise regime and enjoy food without the guilt,\nand it was liberating when I recently noticed I'd put on a few pounds and\nrealised I didn't care.\n\nI might not be ready to flaunt every curve, dimple and love handle on Instagram,\nbut I'm not horrible to myself any more either. At last, I accept my body - and\nfor me, that's a huge triumph. F",

            "content_plain": "SARAH GRIFFITHS, 43, RUNS A CANDLE BUSINESS AND LIVES IN BLACKWOOD, SOUTH WALES,\nWITH HUSBAND LEIGHTON. SHE HAS TWO SONS, EVAN, 14, AND ZAK, NINE. \n\n\"Standing in front of the mirror I stepped into my gold off-the-shoulder dress.\nAs I looked at my reflection, I tried hard not to cry. It should have been my\ndaughter Daisy standing in my bedroom admiring herself, not me.\n\nWhen Daisy was born on Christmas Eve 2002, she was the best present ever. I had\nEvan three years later, followed by Zak in 2010, but my bond with Daisy always\nremained strong. From days out in the park to pamper parties, we enjoyed every\nsecond together.\n\nIt used to make me smile when Daisy was 11 and would chat excitedly with her\nfriend Molly about their prom night at Islwyn High School, even though it was\nyears away. I could just imagine her painting everyone's nails and getting her\nmake-up just right.\n\nDaisy was always sporty, and by the age of 12 was into netball, athletics and\ncross-country running. But in June 2015 she began to have pains and spasms in\nher leg, so the GP sent her for a scan at Nevill Hall Hospital to investigate.\nFollowing that she was urgently referred for an MRI, which showed a mass on her\npelvic area. She had a biopsy, and when we got the results back on July 16,\n2015, we were given the horrific news that Daisy had Ewing sarcoma, a rare form\nof bone cancer.\n\nThe doctor explained it was curable, but she would need chemotherapy and would\nprobably lose her hair. I managed to hold it together for Daisy, but in private\nI cried myself to sleep each night. When she started her treatment that August,\nwe had to shave her hair as it began falling out. Knowing that the cancer was\ncurable gave my husband Leighton and me the strength to stay positive for Daisy\nand the boys.\n\nFinally, in August 2016, after 18 months of gruelling chemo, Daisy finished her\ntreatment, ringing the bell at the children's hospital in Cardiff with joy.\nHowever, three weeks later, a follow-up CT scan showed the cancer was in her\nlungs. Heartbreakingly, this time it wasn't curable.\n\nI was floored. Daisy tried to stay upbeat, but as the months went by I could see\nmy beautiful girl growing weaker. There was no more treatment available, only\npain management, and she wore a morphine patch most days.\n\nWe decided to focus on making memories. Local charity Dreams & Wishes sent Daisy\nto Welsh national rugby matches as a VIP, and gave her an iPad so she could\nvideo call her pals during long hospital stays. In March 2017, friends and\nfamily organised a fund-raising ball called Daisy's Dance. That night, I wrapped\nmy arms around my little girl's tiny frame and we danced together. I had a big\nsmile on my face, but inside I was broken.\n\nAfter the ball, Daisy's health deteriorated. A few days later a nurse visited\nthe house and Daisy asked her if it was time for her to go. The nurse said yes,\nand Daisy collapsed into my arms, saying that she didn't feel ready and wanted\nto go to prom. It was devastating to hear. On May 1, 2017, aged just 14, she\npassed away at home with us by her side. I knew I'd never be the same again.\n\nAlthough we were upset, we wanted to make sure Daisy's funeral was a celebration\nof her life. We packed it full of happy memories and played her favourite Ed\nSheeran song Castle On The Hill. Since then we've had good and bad days. I'll\noften cry openly in front of the kids if I feel sad, as I feel we should let our\nemotions out.\n\nIt's been so important to me to keep Daisy's memory alive, so last year I became\nan ambassador for Dreams & Wishes, organising events and sharing my story to\ncelebrate her legacy. In May this year, Libby, one of Daisy's best friends,\nasked if I'd like to come to their prom in Daisy's place to honour her. I asked\nher if she was sure as it might be upsetting, but Libby insisted that they\nwouldn't do it without me.\n\nThe night before I couldn't stop crying, but on the day my pride for Daisy and\nher friends took over. Zak walked me down the red carpet in a suit, and in the\nschool hall I stayed close to the teachers for support because watching all the\nkids having an amazing night left me overwhelmed with emotion. It was great\nbeing there on behalf of Daisy, but it was also bittersweet. While the other\nparents were still looking forward to their children's futures, Daisy will\nalways be 14 to me.\n\nTwo years on, it still hits me hard some days. But Daisy never gave up and I\ncan't either. She was a gift to me for 14 years and I'll treasure her forever.\"\nF BTW Ewing sarcoma is a rare cancer that affects the long bones, ribs, pelvis\nand spine. It usually occurs in teenagers, and is more common in boys.\n\nFor help and support, visit Macmillan.org.uk.\n\nClockwise from top left: Sarah at the prom with Zak in May; dancing with Daisy\nat a fund-raising ball in March 2017; Daisy during treatment, aged 13",

            "content_plain": "ROBERT RINDER, 41, IS DAYTIME TV'S MOST FAMOUS JUDGE AND ALSO STARRED ON\nSTRICTLY COME DANCING IN 2016. \n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nComing to the end of my life unfulfilled.\n\nOr dying in a banal way. For years I lived and worked in the Caribbean, but I\nnever learned to scuba dive because I thought: \"Can you imagine the snickering\nin the crematorium if I died of the bends?\" \n\nWhich word do you overuse?\n\nI'm saying ostensibly a lot recently. And curate.\n\nWhat is your worst habit?\n\nI don't have any ugly bad habits. I could never commit to drink or drugs and I\ndon't really pick my nose.\n\nWhat does being in love feel like?\n\nMadness. Love interferes with every facet of your emotional chemistry. It has\nthe capacity to improve everything. It makes you feel like everything will be\nfine.\n\nWho would you invite to a dinner party?\n\nI met Emma Thompson not long ago and I had to prepare the discussion beforehand\nbecause my friend said it was likely it'd look like I should be sectioned. So\nI'd love her, [Russian novelist] Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, [late writer]\nChristopher Hitchens and Joan Rivers. That would be quite a party! Leave or\nRemain?\n\nI don't do politics, but neither do I delight in sitting on the fence. If you\ntake the court seriously, don't talk about politics.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nI am genuinely confident I have memories of being born. I can certainly remember\nbeing in my cot and thinking: \"What can I do to get my mum to come in here?\" and\n\"Why has she decorated this room so appallingly?\" \n\nWhat possession would you rescue from a burning building?\n\nI have some lovely art and lots of books, but it would have to be my lucky\nhairbrush. I'm not superstitious, but I've had it for about 20 years. I've\ntravelled around the world with it.\n\nWho was your first kiss?\n\nI think it was Nikki Glazer when I was In 11 - she had braces. And the good news\nis we've been great friends since we were seven. We meet twice a year. Which\nceleb would you love to snog?\n\nTaron Egerton. I was on a plane with him but had no idea who he was and he fell\nasleep in a slightly compromising way. He is the most beautiful human I have\never seen close up.\n\nIf you could travel back in time, where would you go?\n\nI wouldn't mind being in the court of Louis XIV as long as I had a grand\nposition. And it would be fun to hang around with the Bloomsbury Set in the\n'20s.\n\nClean or messy?\n\nNot just clean - fiercely clean. The most important person in my life is Petia,\nmy cleaner. I auditioned 12 and I settled on her. To me the smell of bleach is\nChanel No.5. \n\nWhat's top of your bucket list?\n\nI think it's dangerous to have a bucket list because you over-romanticise grand\nthings, which is a sure-fire way to disappoint. But I'd like to meet Howard\nStern and read War And Peace in Russian. What is your biggest regret?\n\nThere are far too many to articulate! F ?\n\nWatch The Rob Rinder Verdict, Friday, 10pm, Channel 4.\n\n'I have far too many regrets to articulate'",

I set my alarm for 5.50am so that I can\nhave two snoozes until 6.10am, when I'll roll out of bed and into the shower. I\nwash my hair every morning, otherwise I feel gross and my roots look greasy.\nI've now mastered the art of getting ready, including drying my hair and letting\nour cavapoo Fred out for a quick wee by 6.30am. Then I'll grab a banana and\ndrive to work. I love a strong Yorkshire tea. I drink two cups while I get my\nmake-up done before filming begins. I share a dressing room with Amy Walsh\n[Tracy Metcalfe] and Emma Atkins [Charity Dingle] and we love a gossip -\nanything to fill the 40 minutes. We'll go over any lines together while getting\ninto our outfits before heading to set for the first scene at 8am.\n\nMy job is an emotional rollercoaster. Vanessa Woodfield - my character in the\nsoap - is going through a lot of break-up-induced heartache. It can be touching\nbut draining to constantly act out those emotions, so as a team we try to keep\nit light-hearted between scenes. But I wouldn't have it any other way. I love my\njob and I thrive off being busy. We'll get four scenes done in the morning\nbefore we have lunch. I'm a sucker for crisps. Alongside my tuna and cheese melt\nfrom the ITV Studios canteen, I'll have salt and vinegar crisps. I also love\nfish and chips on a Friday. Some of my colleagues will do yoga or go on a run\nduring the break - I don't! I might try and do a plank now and again. I work\nwith my wife. Kate [Brooks, 42] is a producer on Emmerdale, so we're both tied\nto the studios. Once we're finished for the day at about 6pm, we'll have a cosy\nevening indoors. Whoever gets home first will prepare tea. Kate doesn't eat red\nmeat any more so we'll have a chicken stir-fry and pop on whatever series we're\nhooked on at the time. At the moment we're obsessed with Stranger Things and Big\nLittle Lies. About 40 minutes later I'll have my head in the treat cupboard.\nWeekends are hectic. Our jobs are really demanding, so weekends are spent trying\nto squeeze in friends and family. Kate's family live in Liverpool and we\nregularly travel to see them from our house in Leeds. We also have to do boring\ntasks such as getting tax, VAT and bills in order. For a special treat we'll go\nto the theatre or to a gig. This year we've already seen Kylie twice, Pink,\nBilly Joel and Rod Stewart. Our guilty pleasure is having a TV in the bedroom. I\nknow some people don't agree with having one where you sleep, but we love it. We\ntry to sleep at 10pm, but we'll always watch one more episode. I never make it\npast the first half, though, and my eyes shut around 10.30pm. ? Watch Emmerdale,\nweeknights, 7pm, ITV.",

Elle, via email CPTSD is a\ndistressing condition where it is difficult to control your emotions. You may\nfeel hostile to or distrustful of others and that no one understands you, as\nwell as feeling isolated and depressed. Talking therapies and EMDR (using rapid\neye movements when describing trauma) plus antidepressants can help. Visit\nNhs.uk for psychological therapies (IAPT) and Mind.org.uk for local resources.\nAlso try audiobooks like The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel van der Kolk.\n\nI was told to stop taking alendronic acid for osteoporosis and now I have a\ndifferent infusion once a year instead.

If so, bring this to a head, challenge him\ndirectly, be prepared to hear bad news and handle that, for surely it's better\nto know the truth than to keep wondering? Or has your boyfriend never been\nunfaithful but he's picked up on your jealousy and it's making him feel nervous,\nwhich is why he's acting strangely even though nothing happened?

            "content_plain": "alking into a student club with friends, Josie* locked eyes with a man across\nthe room and felt her chest tighten.\n\nW\"I tried to fight back a panic attack as the memories flooded my mind. Just a\nfew months before, he'd choked me unconscious and then raped me,\" says Josie,\n21.\n\n\"Despite my constant pleas to the university, he hadn't been suspended and I was\nforced to live in constant fear of bumping into him.\"\n\nJosie had been studying geography at a British university when the alleged\nattack happened last December. Despite police currently investigating, her\nfellow student is still studying at the same university. Terrified of seeing\nhim, Josie has postponed her degree. She is also suffering from post-traumatic\nstress disorder.\n\n\"My life has changed forever, but he still walks around campus as if nothing has\nhappened,\" says Josie. \"The university has completely failed to protect me. I\nfeel humiliated and let down.\"\n\nJosie's ordeal comes as rape culture at UK universities reaches an all-time\nhigh. Recent research by sexual health and wellbeing charity Brook revealed that\nmore than half of students have experienced unwanted advances or assault. And\nthe situation has worsened, with the number of allegations reported to police\nrising tenfold in four years, from 65 in 2014 to 626 in 2018.* But given that\nsuch a tiny proportion of people report attacks, the real figures are likely to\nbe much higher.\n\nIn recent years, students at Goldsmiths, University of London, have protested\nagainst the institution's response to sexual harassment claims, while similar\ndemonstrations have been staged by those studying at Roehampton and Bristol. On\ntop of this, the University of Cambridge is being sued by former student\nDanielle Bradford over its handling of her sexual harassment complaint. She\nclaims that she was discouraged from launching a formal complaint despite being\nbombarded with sexual texts by a course supervisor.\n\nNina Burrowes, a psychologist and founder of The Consent Collective, which runs\nworkshops and lectures on campuses, says universities are failing to both\nprotect and support students. \"Sexual violence cannot be tolerated anywhere, but\nuniversity students are particularly at risk because they are away from home for\nthe first time,\" she says.\n\nUniversities UK, a representative organisation for all universities across the\nUK, established a task force in 2016 to address sexual violence, but admits\nthere is still work to be done.\n\n\"Every case is one too many,\" spokesperson Clara Plackett says. \"It is important\nto create an environment where students feel able to come forward confident that\nan incident will be addressed. We will be publishing guidance in the coming\nacademic year and recommendations on what further action is necessary to drive\nimprovement, as well as a sector-wide survey to assess progress.\"\n\nBut for Josie, this is too little too late.\n\n\"My attacker asked to walk me home from a club and I accepted because I thought\nI'd be safer with him,\" she says. \"When we got back to mine he asked to come\ninside to warm up. Once he was in my house, he kissed me against my will before\nchoking me. I passed out and when I woke up he was raping me. I was terrified.\"\n\nThe next day Josie went to hospital to get checked over. The police were called\nand took her to a sexual assault referral centre (SARC), where she was examined\nand prescribed HIV prevention medication, but she was afraid to take the case\nfurther. \"I'd heard horror stories about women torn to pieces in court and I\ncouldn't cope with that,\" she says.\n\nBut two months after the attack, backed by witnesses, she submitted a report to\nher university. Josie hoped the institution would suspend her rapist because his\nbehaviour violated the student code of conduct.\n\n\"I didn't feel safe on campus and I wanted the guy out of uni,\" says Josie.\n\n\"I emailed the university countless times, but I was told that I'd have to wait.\n\nWeeks went by and I heard nothing.\"\n\nTerrified of bumping into her attacker, the former A* student began to fall\nbehind with her work and applied for student counselling, but was put on a\nthree-month waiting list. \"I couldn't concentrate for longer than half an hour,\"\nshe says. \"I wasn't coping well and really needed help.\n\n\"Whenever I walked round the corner or went to the gym, I'd feel sick in case I\nsaw him. The first time I came face to face with him was at a night out that I'd\nbeen looking forward to for months. I was standing in a queue for some food when\nhe came towards me, and I froze.\n\n\"A friend spotted what was happening and came between us, pushing me behind her.\nShaking, I spent the rest of the night surrounded by friends and scared to be\nalone, then I left early.\n\n\"When a space for counselling finally became free, I turned up only to discover\nthat the counsellor was a financial advisor. I'd been booked in with the wrong\nperson and he simply sent me away.\"\n\nThe following month, Josie decided to take matters into her own hands and met\nwith the student president. Together they sent out a rallying cry to other\nstudents who had experienced sexual violence on campus and who felt let down by\nthe university's handling of the situation.\n\nDozens answered their call and the group began meeting frequently to devise an\noutline of what they thought needed to change. In June they approached the\nuniversity with their demands, which included specialised counselling services\nfor assault survivors and a more streamlined approach to banning alleged\nattackers from student events. Within days the university finally took action,\nhiring an independent investigator.\n\nOn the investigator's advice - and at the urging of her parents, who were\nhorrified when she told them what had happened - Josie got in touch with the\npolice again, and the case is now formally being examined. The investigator also\ntold her that he would recommend the university suspend the student, but this is\nyet to happen.\n\nIt was only after a meeting with the vice .\n\nchancellor that Josie found out the university had enforced a no-contact rule on\nher attacker in March, meaning he wasn't allowed to approach her in person or\nonline.\n\nDespite her fears, Josie has no regrets about finally reporting the crime.\n\"Going back to the police was a big decision, but I finally felt like I was\nbeing listened to. It angers me that action was only taken by the university\nwhen I made some noise. They haven't done enough to protect or support me, but\nthe no-contact rule they issued is a step in the right direction.\n\n\"I don't think I'll ever be the same person. I find it really hard to trust\npeople. I've lost a lot of friends, but I've found out who my real ones are, and\nnow I get scared on my own.\"\n\nJosie's university insists that it takes all allegations of sexual violence\n\"extremely seriously\".\n\n\"The university is investing significantly in resources for student wellbeing,\"\nsays a spokesperson. \"We are working closely with the students' union to create\nan inclusive, respectful and safe campus.\"\n\nIt's also hiring more specialist counsellors and training staff in nightclubs to\nspot sexual harassment, as well as advising lecturers what to do if someone\nconfides in them, and introducing lectures to educate students about consent.\nNevertheless, Josie's alleged attacker still remains a student. After taking\neight months off university to deal with her PTSD and panic attacks, Josie plans\nto restart her degree later this month. \"I don't know how long it will take me\nto recover completely, but I am determined to return to my studies,\" she says.\n\nEvidence that the rape culture at UK universities has reached crisis point was\nnever more apparent than this February, when hundreds of students protested at\nthe University of Warwick after male students made a series of rape threats on a\nprivate message group.\n\nTheir remarks - which included \"sometimes it's fun to just go wild and rape 100\ngirls\" - were reported to the university last year by a female student who had\nbeen mentioned in the chat, and the 11 males in the Facebook group were\ntemporarily suspended from their studies.\n\nStudent Megan Wain, 21, was one of the women targeted.\n\n\"When the girl who'd reported the messages told me about them, I felt sick,\" she\nsays. \"I'd been on nights out with them or sat next to them in lectures. Our\nnames had been retracted from the transcript I saw, and I didn't want to know\nwhat was said about me specifically.\n\n\"It was horrifying. I trusted these men deeply, and some I would even class as\nmy best friends. To see what they were capable of was extremely distressing. I\nwas shocked I hadn't noticed their behaviour as I was so close to them. This\nmade me feel anxious, as I doubted everyone's intentions.\"\n\nDespite the university banning five of the 11 from the campus following an\ninvestigation, they were still allowed to live in their uni accommodation.\n\n\"They were literally living a road away from me,\" says Megan. \"Whenever I saw\none of them walking around, I'd feel sick with anxiety. My friend was approached\nby one of them on the street after she had reported it. He angrily told her to\nstop going any further with her statement and threatened her with his legal\nteam, saying he'd sue her for it.\"\n\nMegan became so distressed that she skipped lectures and social events and began\nsuffering panic attacks. The university encouraged the victims to have\ncounselling, but there was a three-month waiting list. Unable to cope, she moved\nhome to Birmingham in June 2018 after her second year, and for the rest of her\ndegree made the three-hour round trip to campus each day.\n\nBut Megan was dealt another blow this January when she discovered that a 10-year\nexpulsion on two of the men had been lifted following an appeal.\n\n\"I knew nothing about it until a friend told me that she'd read it in the\nstudent paper,\" says Megan. \"The girls mentioned in the chat had been pushing\nfor an update, but the university refused to tell us what was happening because\nof data protection. We felt like we had the right to know, but we were treated\nas though we'd done something wrong.\"\n\nThe decision caused outrage, sparking protests the following month. The hashtag\n#ShameOnYouWarwick went viral on social media. Since then, nearly 85,000 people\nhave signed a petition calling for the culprits to be permanently banned from\nstudying at Warwick.\n\nMegan graduated with a 2.1 and is about to start a master's degree in social and\npolitical theory at the University of Birmingham. But the incident makes it hard\nfor her to trust anyone.\n\n\"It's changed the way I look at every friendship,\" she admits. \"Those men were\nmy mates. I was always round at their house for dinner. I'd gone on nights out\nwith them and I'd trusted them to get me home safely. Then they said such\nexplicit and violent things about me and others. I've been on a few dates\nrecently, but I don't know if I'll be able to trust men again.\n\n\"I also feel let down by the university. The men who said they wanted to rape\nand attack me have got away with it. Without consequences there will never be an\nend to rape culture.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the University of Warwick said: \"We are improving how we\nhandle student disciplinary and appeals processes following recommendations from\nan independent external review.\"\n\nTwo other women mentioned in the chat are suing Warwick over how the university\nhandled the case. They expressed concern about the fact that the investigating\nofficer, Peter Dunn, was also the university's head of press and therefore\nresponsible for protecting the institution's reputation. Warwick admitted \"the\npotential for conflict\" between these two roles, but insists that other members\nof the team looked after media duties during the investigation. The spokesperson\nfor the university adds that it is now providing \"additional specific wellbeing\nresources\" to those affected.\n\nAccording to Nina, the Warwick case is symptomatic of what's happening on many\ncampuses.\n\n\"Part of the reason rape is being [joked] about is that it's taboo, especially\nafter #MeToo. The men are saying: 'Look at how non-PC I am.' But I also think it\nreflects a sense of male entitlement. Bragging seems to have become a thing\namong men to make their friends like them more. What would have been whispered\nin a corridor years ago is now texted or tweeted. Men aren't worried about\nsharing this sort of thing - this generation has grown up with smartphones.\"\n\nBut she adds that times are changing. \"Expectations have adjusted and\nuniversities need to take a zerotolerance approach. The #MeToo generation will\nnot tolerate being ignored any more.\" F\n\n'The university has failed to protect me and I feel let down''The #MeToo\ngeneration will not be ignored any more'",

            "content_plain": "COVER STAR hen the news broke that Catherine Tyldesley had signed up for\nStrictly, one of the first people to get in touch was her former dance teacher.\n\"Well, this is a turn up for the books!\" she joked.\n\nBecause when Cath was at theatre school, she weighed 15st and was so chronically\nlacking in confidence that she did everything she possibly could to dodge dance\nlessons.\n\n\"I never felt body confident enough to do it,\" she says today. \"I felt so much\nbigger than everyone else and I used to think: 'Who would be able to lift me?'\nAbout 90% of the classes I just didn't turn up to. Dance wasn't my thing at\nall.\"\n\nSince then, Cath has dropped from a size 22 to a 10, gained much-needed\nself-esteem and looks completely fabulous, but she says there's still a\npsychological hangover from the days she wrestled with her body image.\n\n\"In my head I'm still too big, so I'm hoping [Strictly] will be a bit\ntherapeutic for me. And it might help me break through everything I'm terrified\nof. At the minute it feels like it's happening to someone else, I'm so far out\nof my comfort zone. I'm scared of doing a forward roll, so god knows how I'll\ncope with the lifts.\"\n\nThe dance training will also give Cath, 35, a new element in her dedicated\nhealth and fitness regime, and it's one she's relishing. She's been upping the\ncardio in preparation for some of the faster-paced Latin dances and is\ninterested to see how her body is going to respond.\n\n\"I'm not skinny - I'd say I'm an average size. I work out and eat well, and\nthis,\" she gestures up and down, \"is as good as it's going to get. I'm not going\nto do anything stupid to get any smaller.\n\n\"I will never have a six-pack and I'm fine with that. It's never going to\nhappen. People are usually lovely to me, but I have the odd person calling me\nfat or too thin. So you can never win. I never read comments in the newspapers\nor on social media - it's bad for your mental health. My husband loves me the\nway I am and that's what's most important.\"\n\nIt's been 13 months since Cath quit Coronation Street leaving Eva \"The Diva\"\nPrice and seven years of tears, laughs and drama behind. It was a brave move,\ntaking her away from the financial security of a regular job, and although she's\ngot work coming out of her ears (apart from Strictly she's also starred in the\nacclaimed 15 Days for Channel 5 and the highly anticipated BBC1 comedy series\nScarborough - more on this later), she admits she was nervous about what the\nfuture held.\n\n\"But I'm also really into positive thinking and just always thought that good\nthings would happen,\" she says. \"Luckily I can sing, so if I had to sing for my\nsupper again, it's OK, I could do that!\n\n\"What is nerve-wracking, though, is turning things down. In the past I've done\nthings I probably shouldn't have. Now I'm older, if it doesn't feel right I\ndon't do it.\"\n\nShe's loved the flexibility that leaving the Street and its 12-hour days has\ngiven her, as well as the extra time at home with \"my boys\" - son Alfie turned\nfour in March and is about to start reception.\n\nAnd the family has also acquired another member in the form of miniature\ndachshund Geoff. Cath jokes that his arrival earlier this year has given PT\nhusband Tom, 32, the impression their family is now complete.\n\n\"Tom thinks that this is his get-out clause. He's like: 'We don't need another\nbaby now!' So, yeah, he needs convincing about having a second baby, but you\nknow, I'm the boss. We will have another one eventually, when the time is\nright.\"\n\nCath and Tom met at a time in her life when she was thoroughly disillusioned\nwith men and intending on staying single after a series of heartbreaks. But\nlife's a funny old game, and Alfie was conceived within months of them getting\ntogether back in 2014. She has spoken before about the happy surprise that\nturned her world upside down in the best possible way.\n\n\"If it had been any of my friends I would have been like: 'Whoa.' But Tom was\namazing from start to finish and Alfie was the best surprise.\n\n\"Looking back, we were both so broody. If we were at a social event we'd end up\nwith other people's babies, so it wouldn't have been long before we started\ntrying anyway. He is just the best dad and they are like two peas in a pod.\"\n\nLike many mums, Cath worries about getting the work/life balance right and\nregularly has attacks of guilt if she thinks she's falling short. But she's a\nrecent meditation convert, and the practice is helping keep a sense of\nperspective.\n\n\"I sometimes feel like I'm the only mum who forgets about teddy bear breakfast\nor cake bake day. You are constantly surrounded by guilt. But since I've started\nmeditating it's been amazing. It just resets you, especially when you're a mum\nand you're go, go, go all day. Kids have no mercy.\n\n\"I think it's important for your mental health to just breathe and be mindful. I\nlive my life at 110mph and love being busy, but I do need to remind myself to\ntake it easier. Like, no need to be so aggressive with the washer! Just put it\nin slowly. .\n\n\"And Alfie is just great. He's just started theatre school and I've turned into\na proper theatre school mum. They're doing Joseph, and because he's a tiddler,\nhe's something like 'Narrator 13' but I've got him doing an American accent so\nhe stands out and people will remember him!\" If rumours are to be believed, Cath\nleft Corrie last August amid unrest among the cast, unhappy with the exhausting\nfilming schedule under new producer Iain MacLeod. She is one of many big names\nto have handed in their notice (Kym Marsh, Lucy Fallon and Faye Brookes, among\nothers, are also saying ta-ra, chuck) and the mass exodus is said to be a sign\nof the troubles. Cath claims this isn't true, and says the constant speculation\nis causing some irritation.\n\n\"Honestly, I feel frustrated for them because I'm in touch with everyone and I\nthink they're all a bit upset about it. It's a brilliant place to work - Iain is\ndoing a great job, but these rumours keep popping up. I had lunch with Jane\nDanson [Leanne Battersby] the other day and I asked her if everything was cool,\nand she was like: 'Yes, it's as great as it has always been!' It's just a pure\ncoincidence that everyone is leaving at the same time.\n\n\"It was my second home for seven years and I have nothing but good things to say\nabout it.\"\n\nWould she ever go back? \"I'd love to at some point. I do get a little pang now\nand again. But it was the right thing to do for my family. I'm often able to do\nthe school run now, which is lovely because of the age Alfie is. That's one of\nthe reasons I turned a lot of things down last year. He was starting pre-school\nand I thought I don't want to look back and feel I missed that section of his\nlife.\n\n\"It's been nice not having to clear holidays with anybody. We've done a lot of\nweekends away in the UK, Dubai, Portugal, France, Spain. It's been lovely.\"\n\nShe says it was former Corrie producer Kate Oates, now at EastEnders, who gave\nher the confidence to spread her wings away from Weatherfield.\n\n\"Kate really fuelled my desire to try other things, and I wanted to do a gritty\ndrama. Amazingly, 15 Days came up and it was brilliantly written and so\nwellreceived. But after that I called my agent and was like: 'I need to do a\ncomedy,' and then Scarborough came in literally a week later.\n\n\"I really feel like comedy is where my roots are. It feels nice to be laughing\ninstead of crying. And when I read the script for Scarborough, I fell in love\nwith all of the characters because it's so warm and genuine.\n\n\"It's been an absolute joy, one of my favourite jobs ever, hands down. No one\nwanted it to finish.\"\n\nScarborough is the latest series from Benidorm writer Derren Litten, and also\nstars Jason Manford and Stephanie Cole. Set in the North Yorkshire seaside town,\nthe show sees Cath and Jason play Karen and Mike, a couple who are trying to\ngive their relationship another go five years after they split.\n\n\"Jason became like my brother,\" says Cath of the friendship the two of them\ndeveloped during filming.\n\n\"Straight away I felt so comfortable with him. I often think that comedians make\nbrilliant actors because they're very observant of people, and he just blew me\naway. We have some tender, almost heartbreaking, scenes - even though it's a\ncomedy there are still beautiful scenes - and he totally had me.\n\n\"I remember we did a fairground scene on this ride for about three hours and\nJason was making me laugh so much I dribbled. The ride was going so fast the\ndribble just went all over him and then my boob fell out. The whole thing was\nhysterical.\"\n\nThe people of Scarborough \"couldn't have been more welcoming\" and Cath reckons\nthe show might work wonders for the seaside town's tourist industry.\n\n\"It's such a charming town and an absolute dream to film in. Derren won some\ntourism awards for Benidorm because the show increased the numbers of visitors,\nand I think that will happen with Scarborough. It's so gorgeous and it's been\nshot beautifully.\"\n\nCath says she tried to eat healthily during filming and trained with kettlebells\nbetween scenes (\"the location guys hated me because they had to lug them around\neverywhere\"), but the local fish and chips often proved too much of a\ntemptation.\n\n\"This past six months has been the most difficult in terms of training because I\njust haven't had the time. There were points where I hadn't exercised in weeks\nand I really missed it. It's a mental thing for me - it's not really about\nweight loss any more. It's more that if I eat badly I don't feel great. And\nafter a few days of not doing something I start to feel a bit narky.\"\n\nEnter Strictly Come Dancing. It seems to have come round at the perfect time in\nmore ways than one.\n\n\"Yeah, it feels right,\" she agrees. \"Last year it wasn't the right time but now\nis good.\"\n\nShe laughs off any mention of the infamous Strictly Curse, though.\n\n\"Obviously there's a history of things happening, but Tom is really chilled out\nabout it to the point where I'm like: 'Are you even bothered?' \"But he gets on\nwith everybody and that's why we work, and he wants to be part of the experience\nas much as I do. There's just something so special about Strictly. I've always\nbeen a huge fan of the show, my whole family love it, it's so well-loved and\nclassy and brilliant. To actually be on it is a dream come true.\" F. Scarborough\nstarts Friday, 9.30pm, BBC1.\n\nTHE LASTBook you read? Gracie Fields' biography for a play I did earlier this\nyear.\n\nShe was so fascinating.\n\nMovie you watched? Green Book. Amazing - so good.\n\nBox set you watched? This Is Us.

And with single Hello My Love soaring to the top of the charts in January,\nplus more soon-to-be released tracks written by James Bay and self-confessed\nWestlife fan Ed Sheeran, expectations are high.\n\nWhether you love 'em or think they're a tad cheesy, more than two decades on\nfrom the release of their first single Swear It Again the band's popularity has\nundoubtedly endured. With 55 million records sold worldwide, they remain the\nonly band to have their first seven singles enter the UK charts at No.1. Despite\ntheir successes, they have also faced their fair share of challenges, including\nBrian McFadden's departure in 2004 and a seven-year hiatus when it looked like\nthey'd never reunite.\n\nWe sat down with the boys to hear all about their split, the reunion, life on\nthe road again and juggling the band with fatherhood \n\nSHANE FILAN, 40 \n\nWhen the band split in 2012, was a reunion always part of the plan?\n\nNo, definitely not. After our last gig at Croke Park [Dublin, in June 2012] that\nwas it, we were done. We genuinely weren't enjoying it any more. It's only in\nthe last couple of years that I started to really miss the other guys and\nperforming together enough to want to do it all over again. are you doing\nanything differently this time around?\n\nBefore, we worked too much, didn't have enough time off, didn't see our families\nenough, so we burnt out and were sick of Westlife. This time family comes first\n- we have nine children between us, with one on the way. If we're on the road,\nwe're never away longer than 10 days before we have a break. In the future I\ndon't want my kids [Nicole, 14, Patrick, 10, and Shane, nine] to say: \"You were\nalways working, Dad.\"\n\nyou've had a successful solo career, but why didn't you go down the reality tV\nroute like kian and Nicky?\n\nI was offered every show two or three times, but it was never for me. All I've\never wanted to do is sing and that didn't change after the band split. Now Mark\nand I are writing together, which is brilliant. Kian and Nicky always loved\nreality shows, but it never appealed to me. is there still an appetite for bands\nlike Westlife?\n\nI think there will always be a demand for bands that make good music. So much\nhas changed since we've been away, though, and our new songs need to fit into\nthis new scene. If we released Flying Without Wings or Swear It Again now, they\nwouldn't get played on the radio. These days it's songs with tempo that get\nairtime, which is why Hello My Love was such a massive hit for us.\n\nWhat do you say to criticism that this reunion is just about cashing in?\n\nIf that was the case we could have done it years ago. We've been asked so many\ntimes. But it never felt right - we all only wanted to do it for the right\nreasons. If it was just about the money, we could have done a nostalgia tour\nthen disappeared again. We wouldn't have signed a new deal and recorded an\nalbum, with plans to tour again. you and wife Gillian were declared bankrupt in\n2012 and 2018 respectively. after such a difficult time, does 2019 feel like a\nnew chapter for you both?\n\nI feel like now it's time to enjoy life - both family and band life. Everything\nfeels more special this time around. Getting to share it all with Gillian and\nthe kids is incredible.\n\nNICKY BYRNE, 40 \n\nWhy did you decide to go back?\n\nMy dad died 10 years ago and something I inherited from him was his work ethic.\nI'm too young to sit about doing nothing. Also, my 12-year-old sons Rocco and\nJay have only vague memories of me performing last time around and my daughter\nGia, five, has never known me as a pop star, so I wanted them to see this side\nof me. the band has always managed to maintain a squeaky-clean image. are you\njust better than other acts at hiding bad behaviour?\n\nWe all loved a drink, but falling around a hotel bar after one too many was\nabout as scandalous as it got. I've never taken drugs or even smoked a\ncigarette. Now with so many children between us there are fewer late nights and\nthe beers on the backstage rider have been replaced with Percy Pigs!\n\nWhy isn't brian part of the band's reunion?\n\nWe tried everything to keep Brian as part of the band in 2004, but he walked\naway and we s**t ourselves. We realised if we wanted Westlife to survive, we\nneeded to pull together. Him leaving really galvanised us and we became\nsomething different. Brian wouldn't know this band if he stepped back into it\nbecause this isn't the band he left. I wish him all the best, but I don't know\nhim any more. .\n\nAs a band, you've never been seen as cool. Does it bother you?\n\nWhen I was younger it definitely did. I was always a cool guy, then I found\nmyself dressed in a black suit singing Mandy and people were slagging me off!\nNow I don't care so much. As the years went by we became boring. We weren't\npicking the records ourselves - Simon Cowell was doing it, but he'd lost\nconfidence in us and didn't know how to pick a hit for us. We'd spend months\nmaking original music then he'd insist we do a cover. It would be a big hit but\nwasn't necessarily what we wanted to sing. What's next for Westlife?\n\nI look at Take That as an example of how a band can come back from a split and\ncarry on for years with credibility. I think we can keep Westlife in our lives\nforever this time.\n\nKIAN EGAN, 39 \n\nWhat do you make of Brian McFadden tweeting last year that ego is destroying the\npotential for a five-man Westlife reunion?\n\nThat's completely untrue. We started as a five-piece and five years in he\ndecided he didn't want to do it any more. We went on for eight more years and\nbecame a different band, and that's the one you see today.\n\nDo you sing more lead vocals on the new album?\n\nDefinitely. I'm much more confident. In the past we were told Mark and Shane\nsang the lead parts and that's just the way it was. Now I've had a successful\nsolo album and commanded an audience of 20,000 people on my own, you're\ndefinitely going to hear more from me.\n\nYou've got three boys - Koa, seven, Zekey, four, and Cobi, 23 months. Any plans\nfor another, or are you and wife (former Hollyoaks actress Jodi Albert) done?\n\nNot right now. It would be crazy to have a fourth when I'm back on the road and\nworking so much again, but it's definitely a possibility. I love the idea of\nhaving a little girl after three sons - it's hard to think of never getting to\nwalk a daughter down the aisle on her wedding day. But I also believe you get\nthe babies you're meant to get, so if we did have another, as long as it was\nhealthy, I'd be happy. How did you feel when the band split in 2012?\n\nI was the one fighting to keep it going, more than anyone else. One night, we\nwere drunk in a taxi after a night out and I blurted out: \"This is stupid, lads,\nI really think we're going to miss this.\" You could have heard a pin drop! But\nthey were right - we had to end on a high rather than see it all dwindle away.\nDoes it feel different now?\n\nI feel like we're getting to live the dream a second time around, but this time\nwe're in control. In the early years there was a lot of fear instilled in us,\nthat if we didn't do what we were told and keep going it would all fall apart.\nIn the end, we broke. This time we're making the decisions and it feels great.\n\nMARK FEEHILY, 39 \n\nYour first baby is due later this year - congrats! How are you feeling about\nbecoming a dad with fiancé Cailean?\n\nIt's the best thing that's ever happened to me. It's something I've wanted for\nyears, I've always been a broody guy, but now everything is so great in my\npersonal life and my career, the time feels right. It hasn't been a knee-jerk\nreaction, we've been researching the surrogacy process for the last three years.\n\nHow involved are you with the mother?\n\nFully involved. This is something she has wanted to do all her life. It's as far\nfrom a cold, hard commercial transaction as you can get. Cailean and I have been\nat scans and appointments with her, and when we haven't been able to be there in\nperson, we've Skyped in.\n\nDo you know who the biological father is?\n\nFor now we're keeping that private. I want to wait until we feel comfortable\nsharing some parts of this journey. The baby's not even here yet and I'm blown\naway by how protective I feel of it. Just posting a scan on Instagram to\nannounce the pregnancy felt like a huge step.\n\nYou haven't always been in such a good place, have you?\n\nI've had ups and downs in my life, but Cailean has been such a positive\ninfluence. In the past I was always searching - for love, a new career after\nWestlife ended I never felt fulfilled. Now I've found everything I was looking\nfor. I used to be out every night, now I'm happiest at home in Sligo with a\nglass of red wine and a box set. I wish I could tell my 14-year-old self how\ncontent I am now with who I am as a person, my sexuality and the life I've built\nfor myself.\n\nWhat brought you back to the band?\n\nThe day after our final gig I got on a plane to America with no idea when I was\ncoming back. I desperately needed to get away and push a reset button in my\nhead. It took a long time, but eventually I missed it - the boys, the crowds,\nsinging my first line in Flying Without Wings and hearing thousands of people\nlose their minds. I wanted all that again. F. Westlife's new album Spectrum is\nout on November 15. Preorder at Westlife.com.\n\nWATCH IT!Watch our exclusive video with Westlife at Fabulousmag.\n\nco.uk now.\n\n'I desperately needed to push a reset button in my head' MARK",

            "content_plain": "By MICHAEL MORGAN SUB Wayne Routledge SUPER SUB Wayne Routledge plundered a\ndramatic lastgasp winner to send Swansea top of the Championship.\n\nThe winger, on for Yan Dhanda, fired home from close-range after the Leeds\ndefence had failed to clear Matt Grimes' 90th-minute ball into the box.\n\nIt was a strike that kept City's impressive unbeaten start to the season going\nand came after they had taken a real pounding from the home side.\n\nEven Swans boss Steve Cooper was honest enough to admit: \"I don't know about it\nbeing the perfect performance, but it was certainly the perfect result for us\naway from home.\n\n\"We had to work very hard for it, that's for sure.\n\n\"But we defended properly and showed no fear.\n\n\"Every one of my players performed well and we tried to come here and win the\ngame.\n\n\"Now we can look forward to going into the international break on top of the\ntable.\n\n\"We've worked hard to get where we are, we are progressing as a team and I'm\nvery happy with that.\n\n\"But it's far too early to start making any predictions.\n\n\"There are still 40 league games to go and all we've done is give ourselves a\ngood start.\"\n\nLeeds, who welcomed back skipper Liam Cooper after two weeks out with an ankle\ninjury, had won their previous ten home meetings with Swansea.\n\nAnd victory number 11 looked on the cards as the Swans did well to survive a\nbattering in the opening 20 minutes.\n\nDesperate defending coupled with much-needed slices of luck came to their\nrescue.\n\nThe first chance came after only four minutes when Ezgjan Alioski cleverly\ncreated space for himself before firing a rising drive from the edge of the box\ninches over.\n\nAnd it was the Macedonian who went close again when, from a Stuart Dallas feed\nfour minutes later, he let fly with a blistering drive which drew\nLeeds......................................0\nSwansea................................ 1 a smart save from Freddie Woodman.\nThen, on 11 minutes, Patrick Bamford scuffed a close range shot after a\nbeautiful Pablo Hernandez corner.\n\nBamford was also out of luck when he arrowed a header inches wide from a\n16th-minute Dallas corner.\n\nThe visitors did not get a sight of Kiko Casilla's goal until the 34thminute\nwhen skipper Grimes smacked an angled free-kick from just outside the box into\nthe side-netting.\n\nUnited then found top gear again, Dallas seeing a full-blooded volley bravely\nblocked by Joe Rodon.\n\nAnd, on the stroke of half-time, Cooper was unfortunate to plant a header\nagainst the bar from another well-flighted Hernandez corner.\n\nThere was no let-up from Leeds after the break either.\n\nBamford was out of luck again with an angled shot on the turn which flew just\nover with Woodman beaten.\n\nCity's rearguard was carved open for the umpteenth time three minutes later, but\nWoodman did well to hold on to a 20-yard Hernandez scorcher.\n\nBoss Marcelo Bielsa threw on striker Eddie Nketiah to replace Bamford on 61\nminutes, and the new darling of the Leeds fans had to wait only four minutes\nbefore getting his first sniff.\n\nThe Arsenal loanee had scored three times in four outings for the Yorkshire side\nand looked on course for a fourth as he outpaced his markers.\n\nBut, this time, his radar was off as he blazed a 20-yard drive over.\n\nThen came Routledge's smash and grab winner to knock Leeds off top spot and have\nBielsa bemoaning missed chances.\n\nThe Argentine said: \"We had 12 or more goalscoring opportunities, 70 per cent of\nthe ball and good refereeing, so I'm not going to blame bad luck.\n\n\"The performance was very positive from each player.\n\n\"There was a good balance in the team but we just couldn't break down Swansea's\nresistance.\n\n\"I am disappointed we are not going into the international break with a win but\nI am happy with our start to the season.\"\n\nJutkiewicz 73 Lindsay 58 Bellingham 76 Att: 20,652 BIRMINGHAM: Camp, Colin,\nRoberts, Dean, Pedersen, Villalba (Crowley), Davis, Sunjic, Montero\n(Bellingham), Alvaro Gimenez, Jutkiewicz (G Gardner).

            "content_plain": "MAN CITY.........4 De Bruyne 2; Aguero 42, 55; B Silva 79 BRIGHTON..........0\nHOME comforts, seventh heaven and a century of smiles ... Sergio Aguero is\nleaving City fans spoilt for choice this season.\n\nAnother double from the champions' deadliest marksman brought up 101 goals in\n134 games under Pep Guardiola.\n\nNot bad for a guy whose workrate the gaffer doubted so much at first that he\nwent out and spent £28.6million on Gabriel Jesus.\n\nA double which made it 99 goals at the Etihad  a record just Wayne Rooney and\nThierry Henry, at Old Trafford and Highbury respectively, can better for Prem\ngoals at one venue.\n\nA double which made it six in just four matches before the end of August for the\nArgentine. And just for good measure, a double which means Aguero's last seven\nshots on target have all ended in the back of the net.\n\nAll of which ensured a fixture that on paper always looked like one of the\nbiggest mismatches you'll see all year, did indeed end up as just that.\n\nTo be fair to all those who questioned Brighton's 33-1 odds  although there\nwere not too many outside of East Sussex  it did take just 69 seconds to see\nwhy.\n\nThat is how long it took before City were ahead. That is how long before an\nuphill task became an Everest-sized one, as the first real attack brought the\nultimate reward.\n\nIndeed, you could have added a nought to Brighton's price and there still would\nnot have been many takers.\n\nThe worrying thing for them in that blink-of-an-eye opening was how easily they\nwere sliced open.\n\nThere was not a hint of onetouch, pinball-passing incision about it, either.\n\nJust a ball down the line from Oleksandr Zinchenko, a pull back from David Silva\nand Kevin De Bruyne, nonchalantly strolling into the box to sidefoot home from\neight yards.\n\nRiyad Mahrez fired straight at keeper Mat Ryan after jinking impishly inside, De\nBruyne drilled a low fizzer a couple of feet wide and Aguero pulled another just\ntoo far left.\n\nOh and in between times, Kyle Walker took out the frustration of his England\naxing in a thunder-ing 50-50 with Dale Stephens that had 50,000-plus wincing.\n\nNot half as much as they were ten minutes from the break, when Aymeric Laporte\nflew into a challenge  although it was more like an assault  to stop Adam\nWebster.\n\nIt certainly did that, earning a justifiable yellow card.\n\nMore worrying was the sight of Laporte leaving on a stretcher in agony, his\nright knee banged horribly in the collision.\n\nWith John Stones sidelined and no new centre-back in the summer  Harry Maguire\nanyone?  Pep will be praying the Frenchman is not too seriously injured.\n\nBut the way Laporte immediately flung his arm into the air for treatment and the\nanguish on his face, made it look like we are talking months rather than weeks.\n\nThat brief Brighton foray was also a timely slap in the face that, for all the\ndominance, a one-goal cushion still meant where there is life and all that. But\nnot for long. Not after Aguero pounced for the first time in the afternoon.\n\nAnd if the opener was a pretty basic affair, this one had the Guardiola stamp\nrunning through it from start to finish.\n\nIt began with Zinchenko to Nicolas Otamendi on halfway and continued with Walker\nrolling a ball forwards from midfield  and that is when the gentle strokes\nbecame rapier thrusts.\n\nMahrez backheeled telepathically to the right, De Bruyne delivered radar-like at\nfull pace and Aguero stepped back across before smashing into the roof of the\nnet.\n\nIt was magical, magnificent ... and effectively match-ending. Certainly as a\ncontest.\n\nFrom that moment it became damage limitation, even if Fernandinho did have to\nhead one 50th-minute goalbound shot from Leandro Trossard to safety after a\nZinchenko rush of blood. Another shake-from-the-slumbers warning for City? It\nmay well have been because a couple of minutes later it was 3-0. Zinchenko,\nspending more time in the opposition half than his own, fed Silva and when he\nteed up Aguero, the curled edge-ofthe-box strike could not have been more\nclinical.\n\nDe Bruyne went close to a stunning fourth when he volleyed a ball wide.\n\nBut they did not have long to wait for it. And in Bernardo Silva's case, just 17\nseconds after stepping from the bench to replace namesake David.\n\nHis first burst into the box was on to Aguero's set-up, which he despatched\nacross Ryan into the far corner.\n\nTwo-horse race? If City keep up this sort of form, even that will be a tad\noptimistic.\n\nREFEREE: Jon Moss ATTENDANCE: 54,386 DREAM TEAM RATINGS Ederson 7 Zinchenko 7\nWalker 6 Otamendi 7 Laporte 6 Rodri 7 D Silva 7 De Bruyne 8 Aguero 9 Mahrez 8\nSterling 6 6 Maupay 6 Trossard 6 Montoya 6 Bernardo 5 Stephens 5 March 6 Propper\n5 Dunk 6 Webster 6 Burn 5 Ryan SUBS  MAN CITY: Fernandinho (Laporte 37) 7,\nGundogan (De Bruyne 69) 6, B Silva (D Silva 78) 6.

            "content_plain": "THEY sang and sang and sang. And who could blame the visiting fans? From being\nclose to extinction Bolton are very much alive and kicking.\n\nFor much of this summer, their supporters have been on what looked like a death\nmarch to a funeral pyre, the near-certain end of one of the founders of the\nFootball League.\n\nHistory  and do not forget the four FA Cup final triumphs  counts for nothing\nwith hard-headed moneymen in the unyielding world of football finance.\n\nBut that solemn beat was changed dramatically on Wednesday when Football\nVentures took over with Nick Mason, Pink Floyd's percussionist, one of the\nclub's saviours. So despite the result, it was a carnival-like atmosphere at\nPriestfield in the August sun with fans  smiling and laughing in their Bolton\nshirts  showing no signs of fatigue following a monster drive from the\nnorth-west.\n\nEven new CEO Emma Beaugeard turned up wearing a black trackie with a Bolton\nbadge, smiling: \"Oh my God, we're going to win  there are so many Bolton fans\nhere!\" Trotters supporters have had so many false dawns since the club went into\nadministration in May they may have been sceptical about its survival and needed\nproof yesterday.\n\nThat arrived at precisely 1.44pm when the coach carrying a firstteam squad\npacked with fresh-faced kids turned into Redfern Avenue.\n\nNo one was happier than lifelong Bolton fan Alan Cook, a 46-year-old van driver\nfrom Runcorn.\n\nHe said: \"I never thought I'd see this day. Truthfully, I thought we were buried\nlike Bury at the start of the week.\n\n\"I was sat in front of the television crying my eyes out. That's why this game\nis so emotional.\"\n\nThe task now ahead of them is a monstrous one though, bottom of League One on\nminus 11 points having now lost three successive games 5-0. London-based Bolton\nfan Alex Adamson, 30, said: \"If we stay up by the skin of our teeth, I'll be\nover the moon. But it's going to be difficult.\"\n\nBolton were given a warm welcome by Gillingham with owner Paul Scally and\nmanager Steve Evans writing generous words in the matchday programme.\n\nEven the PA announcer said how great it was to see their 740 supporters in the\nBrian Moore Stand, leading to spontaneous applause from home fans.\n\nMen against boys is an old football cliche but it really was yesterday, with\nBolton starting three 18-year-olds  Ronan Darcy, Jordan Boon and Eddie Brown.\n\nThey then brought on sub Callum King-Harmes, even younger at 17.\n\nExactly 27 minutes into the game, the ground erupted into applause for Bury,\nexpelled from the Football League on August 27, with fans chanting \"F*** EFL,\nf*** EFL\".\n\nGills went in two up at the break with goals from Connor Ogilvie and Olly Lee,\nthe son of former England star Robert, who is on loan from Hearts.\n\nBrandon Hanlan added a third in the 54th minute before Lee scored again and Boon\nnetted an own goal. Bolton had their chances, but Brown could not get his shot\naway after rounding the keeper and then one of their veterans, NINETEEN-YEAR-OLD\nDennis Politic, forced a smart save from a free-kick.\n\nJack Hobbs even headed against the bar in the 86th minute.\n\nFormer Rochdale boss Keith Hill was appointed as the Trotters' new manager an\nhour-and-a-half after this defeat.\n\nJimmy Phillips, Wanderers' caretaker chief, knew a permanent appointment was\nneeded.\n\nThe proud Boltonian put the loss into perspective, saying: \"It's tragic what\nhappened to Bury so I'm delighted we still have a club.\n\n\"Yes, it's been difficult with the results but we have a club we can support and\nwork for. We need to get some senior players into the building who've got big\nhearts and are up for a fight.\n\n\"We've got 39 matches to play and need to win four or five more games than the\nothers. It's most certainly achievable although a tough task.\"\n\nGillingham boss Evans added: \"I started at Bolton as a 15-year-old. We needed to\ngo out and produce a performance.\n\n\"From ten minutes to 75, some of our football was outstanding.\"\n\nSo the good news from Priestfield? Bolton are off life-support.\n\nAnd the bad news? There was no bad news despite the thrashing, only cheering,\nclapping and laughing.\n\n\"We love you, Bolton, we do\" they sang at the end. And they meant every word.",

Aguero struck twice to rack up 101 goals under the Spaniard\nand take his tally to half a dozen after just four games this season. And that\nsaw him equal a Premier League best haul for August  level with former City\nstriker Edin Dzeko, who did it in 2011, and Blackburn hotshot Chris Sutton from\n1997. Manager Guardiola purred: \"Sergio has scored goals with Argentina, in Turn\nto Page 3 TON OF FUN ...

I'm so happy for\nhim and the team.\" Pep  who along with his players wore black armbands in\ntribute to former Barcelona team-mate Luis Enrique's nineyear- old daughter,\nXana, who died from bone cancer this week  was also keen to praise Brighton for\ntrying to play football against the champions. He added: \"The result was 4-0 but\nthe performance wasn't because they did really well. \"Few teams come here and\nplay with that courage. \"The difference was, as I have said many times, the\nplayers we have got up front. \"Managers like Graham Potter are very good for\nfootball. \"The credit is to Brighton.

            "content_plain": "FOR more than two years he has been the poster boy of football managers.\n\nTo fellow bosses he was the role model who set the example they all wanted to\nfollow.\n\nTo every club owner, chairman and chief executive he was the perfect man to have\nin charge.\n\nNo transfer kitty? No problem. Certainly no whinging and whining about trying to\ndo the job with one hand tied behind your back.\n\nJust heads down, work with what you've got. Players who would run through walls\nfor the cause. And results that exceeded even the most hard-to-please fan's\ndemands.\n\nIn short, Mauricio Pochettino was the manager everyone  Manchester City and\nLiverpool aside  wanted at their club.\n\nFor the rest, though, they could only dream of a gaffer like that. And all that\nwithout even having a home ground to call his own for 12 months.\n\nSo when Pochettino led Tottenham to the Champions League final, everyone\nbelieved it was just the beginning.\n\nThe platform which, with a decent summer budget and base that could become a\nfortress, would see the promise of silverware turn into reality at last.\n\nOnly in the three months since that night in Madrid, something has happened to\nPochettino.\n\nSomething that is steadily seeing him morph into one of his own managerial\nheroes. And not in a good way.\n\nFor Mauricio has gradually started to sound increasingly like Jose Mourinho.\nOnly not the witty, knock-em-dead Special One of the early years.\n\nMore the grumbling, groaning, never-satisfied curmudgeon of recent seasons.\n\nConsider these utterings of the past couple of months or so ... starting with a\ndig at the players for not showing enough desire.\n\nAdmitting he had no idea which players would still be there after the transfer\nwindow. How that was making him feel vulnerable.\n\nInsisting that it would be more accurate to call him the coach, not the manager,\nbecause he wasn't the one where the buck stopped on transfers. All shocking\ndomestic form under the carpet.\n\nIndeed, since February, Spurs have been the 12th best team in the Premier\nLeague. They've won only six of 17 games.\n\nHad Lucas Moura not hit that last-second winner at the Amsterdam Arena, perhaps\nthere would have been doubts over Pochettino's future from the other side.\n\nOn Friday there was another twist, when the odds on his leaving Tottenham were\nslashed.\n\nSome even suggested he would walk after today's North London derby.\n\nThat, however unhappy he may be, is highly unlikely. Not less than 16 months\ninto a new five-year contract.\n\nBut that's not to say it won't happen a little further down the line. Maybe even\nbefore Christmas. Certainly if another door was to swing open.\n\nOnly last week Poch was stressing how exciting it is to work with young players.\nMost assumed he meant helping bring through the next raft of rookies at\nTottenham.\n\nThen again, wouldn't that be even more the case at Old Trafford? Just a thought\n...\n\na classic Mourinho. Only this time none of them were. Every one was Pochettino.\n\nIf they weren't said by a man who had an agenda, they did nothing to quieten\nthose convinced otherwise.\n\nto If they were said by a man who was trying to manipulate the media, trying to\nget a message across in a \"poor me\" kind of way, then it was all pretty\ncumbersome.\n\nFor while Mourinho at his peak could manipulate the media, and have them dancing\nto his tune without some of them actually realising they'd been drawn in, Poch\nisn't quite as cute.\n\nof Just why he has gone from Mr Happy to Mr Grumpy quite so quickly is the\nhead-scratcher.\n\n.Obviously last week's loss to Newcastle, who you wouldn't have fancied to beat\nan egg to that point, didn't help.\n\nNeither did the saga over Christian Eriksen's future.\n\nBut all of a sudden Pochettino has a longer face than Tiger Roll. Half empty has\ndefinitely taken over from half full.\n\nMaybe we should have seen it coming. After all, that European adventure brushed\nsome pretty",

And the Canaries' loss is proving to be West Ham's\ngain after Haller's flying start to life in England.\n\nYet it was not all sweetness and light for the Hammers and manager Manuel\nPellegrini was far from impressed by his team's early efforts.\n\nThere was a real lack of intensity from his players as they allowed Norwich to\ndominate possession and establish a toehold on the game.\n\nNorwich winger Todd Cantwell was able to slalom through three half-hearted\nchallenges during one particularly slack passage of play.\n\ngamesnot In fact West Ham were so poor they were forced to resort to\ngamesmanship when Yarmolenko was guilty of a shameful dive under Cantwell's\nchallenge in the box.\n\nRef Paul Tierney failed to take any action, which allowed the winger to go down\neasily again with barely any contact from Max Aarons.\n\nBut Norwich were unable to take advantage of their early control and gradually\nconceded the initiative.\n\nFelipe Anderson's charge on goal demanded a heroic last-ditch challenge from\nZimmermann.\n\nBut that was to be the towering German's last meaningful contribution to the\ngame before being taken out by Haller's lunge, which again went unpunished by\nTierney.\n\nAnd Zimmermann was still feeling the effects of that challenge when Haller found\nspace in the penalty area to fire West Ham ahead from Arthur Masuaku's inviting\ncross.\n\nEven that breakthrough goal could not settle Hammers' nerves and they were lucky\nnot to concede a 31stminute equaliser following more unconvincing defending.\n\nUnfortunately for Norwich, Cantwell was millimetres too short to make a clean\nconnection with Aaron's cross and headed a glorious opportunity over from a yard\nout.\n\nAnd any thoughts of a second-half comeback were dismissed when Yarmolenko put\nthe game beyond doubt in the 56th minute.\n\nThe lively Ukrainian certainly did not look like someone still finding his way\nback after ten months on the sidelines with a torn Achilles.\n\nHe pounced on Cantwell's loose control to tee up Mark Noble and when the ball\ncame back to him off Ben Godfrey, he smashed home beyond keeper Tim Krul's dive.\n\nThat was too much for the visitors to bear and Daniel Farke will be concerned at\nhow quickly his players allowed their heads to drop, with only Krul saving them\nfrom a real beating late on.",

            "content_plain": "Chelsea..........2 Abraham 19, 42 Sheff Utd.......2 Robinson 46; Zouma (og) 89\nFRANK LAMPARD watched the youngest Chelsea team in Premier League history blow a\ntwo-goal lead at Stamford Bridge.\n\nAnd even worse last night the baby-faced Blues would struggle to buy a beer in a\nsupermarket to drown their sorrows.\n\nA starting XI with an average age of 24 years and 158 days fell foul of the\nunder-25 rule in many ways.\n\nNot only would they need ID to get booze but they also look worryingly immature\nat times.\n\nThe team which trudged off the pitch at the final whistle included pint-sized\nmidfielder Billy Gilmour, 18, who even if he did have proof of age would\nstruggle to see over the counter.\n\nTwo goals from in-form Tammy Abraham gave them a cushion from which to go on and\nbuild a solid victory. Yet once Sheffield United pulled a goal back less than a\nminute into the second half, Chelsea crumbled.\n\nPerhaps it is because the team is so young the boys out there in blue have such\nshort attention spans.\n\nBoss Lampard's bold policy of giving the kids a chance is to be applauded but it\ncame at a hefty price yesterday.\n\nHe was denied a first home win since taking over as boss in the summer.\n\nAnd for the second game in a row at home he has looked on as his rookies wobbled\nafter getting themselves in the driving seat.\n\nBizarrely it was two of the wiser heads who contributed to their downfall.\n\nSkipper Cesar Azpilicueta allowed himself to be mugged on the edge of his box\nfor the equaliser then Kurt Zouma's outstretched boot scored the calamitous own\ngoal which totally transformed the mood.\n\nEven with Chelsea 2-1 up and clinging on, the punters were loving the\nelectricity in the air as a team of home-grown players were rocking and rolling\nin a game full of ebbs and flows.\n\nWhen Lampard brought on Gilmour  born in the same June week in 2001 his manager\nsigned for Chelsea  for his debut alongside Michy Batshuayi, it looked like\nanother brave masterstroke.\n\nToday it looks like a huge blunder from a man who is himself a rookie in terms\nof management  this being only his second season as a coach.\n\nThe decision to drop Denmark star Andreas Christensen and replace him with\nFikayo Tomori was a surprise one. Replacing a 23-year-old with somebody two\nyears younger was enough to nudge the average age of the starting XI down to a\nrecord in the modern game.\n\nTomori's one and only previous appearance for the first team was as a sub in a\nmeaningless run out against Leicester three years ago.\n\nWithout a shot on target in the first half from the visitors, there was little\nTomori could do in order to impress and stake a claim to keep his place.\n\nBut disaster struck just 50 seconds into the second half when the Blades hit\nback with a goal to remind everyone that Lampard's fledgling Chelsea are a long\nway from a polished team.\n\nTaking the return pass from his throw in on the left flank, Enda Stevens drifted\nthrough the Chelsea defence, stopping en route to nutmeg Azpilicueta.\n\nFrom the by-line he cut the ball back where striker Callum Robinson stood\nunopposed and proceeded to hook the ball into the opposite corner of the net\nfrom eight yards out.\n\nFor a long time now Chelsea have been wobbly. This is not all Lampard's fault.\n\nBut he must be concerned at the lack of mental strength to chuck away a game\nagainst a spirited team but one which should have been rolled over.\n\nAbraham grabbed the first goal on 19 minutes after it had been pawed clear by\nBlades keeper Dean Henderson.\n\nHis second was another example of his striking instincts, capitalising on a\nhorrendous mix-up between Jack O'Connell and George Baldock at the back before\nfiring in.\n\nHenderson made a great save to deny Abraham a hat-trick and Kepa Arrizabalaga\nsaved a longrange bullet from Ollie Norwood. But amid chaos in the Chelsea back\nfour, Zouma stumbled as he tried to defend a cross into the box and the\nFrenchman poked the ball into his own net.",

A tactical switch which moved the infuriating Paul\nPogba into an advanced position, that he felt more worthy of his talents, might\nhave paid dividends on another day.\n\nUnited did not have much luck, but how much do you deserve when you are asking a\n17-year-old striker to save the day with eight minutes to go? Mason Greenwood\nmay go on to be a big player for United and his effort produced the best of a\nnumber of decent saves by home keeper Angus Gunn.\n\nBut Solskjaer's side overall look short on quality and ideas, as well as goals.\n\nThat 4-0 romp against Chelsea just three weekends ago feels like an awfully long\ntime ago.

'James, James will tear you apart again,' sang the away fans, which is\nquite a tribute.\n\nThe chant, to the tune of the Joy Division hit 'Love Will Tear Us Apart', is\nmost associated with United legend Ryan Giggs, the most decorated player in\nEnglish football history.\n\nJames will not win anywhere near as much however long he stays at Old Trafford,\nbut he is the main reason to be cheerful so far this season.\n\nMoments later the Southampton keeper easily gathered a tamer effort from the\nWales international.\n\nBut Gunn had to be alert to beat out a snapshot from James midway through the\nhalf.\n\nIn that spell, James was very much the focal point, more so than England\ncentre-forward Marcus Rashford, but United's overall performance was also\npromising.\n\nThe energy level was mostly high and Solskjaer's side showed purpose and\nambition whenever they had the ball, looking dangerous from almost every attack.\nAt the other end, the visiting defence was rarely troubled after Sofiane Boufal\nhad sent an eighth-minute shot just wide of David De Gea's right-hand post.\n\nSouthampton huffed and puffed but United's wall, with ten men retreating behind\nthe ball when necessary, was made of brick.\n\nThe home team were missing the in-form Nathan Redmond through injury and without\nhim they seemed to lack the guile to find a way through or around it.\n\nUnited's only concern at that stage was how Pogba had seemed to start losing\ninterest, as well as possession, in the latter stages of the opening 45 minutes.\n\nA big part of the reason Southampton gained the upper hand was Pogba's\ncarelessness with the ball.\n\nSure enough, within ten minutes of the restart Che Adams had fluffed Saints'\nbest chance of the game.\n\nThey need not have worried, the equaliser soon arrived.\n\nDe Gea had just kept out a Danny Ings header from a James Ward-Prowse cross.\n\nBut the United keeper was helpless when Danso swung the ball back in and 6ft 6in\nVestergaard outjumped Victor Lindelof to nod home on 58 minutes.\n\nSomething needed to change, so Solskjaer threw on Jesse Lingard, who had been\ndropped to the bench, and asked Pogba to move forward.\n\nWhen Danso was shown a second yellow card for a challenge on McTominay, United\nhad 17 minutes to save themselves from an earlyseason crisis.\n\nGunn saved from James and Rashford, Lingard went close and then Greenwood forced\nthe Saints No 1 into his best stop of the game.\n\nThe Saints survived four minutes of stoppage time pretty easily.\n\nAfter three wins in his last 13 Premier League games, how long will even\nfan-favourite Solskjaer last if things don't improve soon?

If there is one thing everyone knows\nabout the Foxes it is that they have a useful striker. Name of Vardy  you may\nhave heard of him.\n\nLegend has it he is so quick he can switch off his bedroom light and be tucked\nup under the covers before it's dark.\n\nNow fast forward to match day when he pumps himself up by swigging down a\nminimum three cans of a well-known energy drink. Suddenly he is a whippet  with\nwings!\n\nSo how could Bournemouth's dozy defenders fail to fathom it was a bad idea to\nleave Vardy acres of space to run into behind them? Come to think of it, why did\nChris Mepham and Steve Cook fail to cut out the danger at source when they\nwatched Ben Chilwell's hoofed pass travel fully 50 yards towards them? Somehow\nneither thought to apply the simple header required to defend their line and\nsuddenly Vardy was off haring past them.\n\nNaturally, he arrived at the ball first. One bounce off the turf and then a\nsublime lob with the outside of his right boot sent it sailing over Aaron\nRamsdale's head from 25 yards and into the corner of the net.\n\nHowever, three minutes later Leicester were at it as they gifted the Cherries a\nspeedy equaliser.\n\nAdam Smith found Harry Wilson with a throw-in and the winger moved the ball on\nto Ryan Fraser.\n\nThe Scotland international ran at Ricardo Pereira, looked up and threaded a cute\nball behind Jonny Evans to Callum Wilson.\n\nCaglar Soyuncu watched it happen  but somehow did not think to match the\nEngland striker's bread-and-butter run into the channel. That gave Callum Wilson\nthe space he needed to dink the ball beyond Kasper Schmeichel and in off the\npost for his first goal of the season  a decent way to mark his Three Lions\ncall-up.\n\nLeicester responded as James Maddison flashed a header just wide from a Marc\nAlbrighton cross, before Soyuncu almost made amends for his howler by curling a\nshot just over.\n\nAnd the Foxes retook the lead just before half-time.\n\nYou guessed it, the Cherries' defence was caught napping when Vardy turned\nprovider, brushing past a powder-puff challenge from Cook to roll the ball\nacross the face of goal.\n\nYouri Tielemans nipped in to flick it home off the inside of the far post.\n\nAfter the break, VAR roared into action when Belgium midfielder Tielemans was\nguilty of a horrific challenge on Callum Wilson, which saw him rake his studs\ndown the striker's ankle.\n\nIn fairness to Tielemans he had looked to be protecting the ball  and VAR\nagreed that it was not a malicious challenge  although he was still a lucky boy\nto stay on the park.\n\nIronically, he could not even be yellow carded, as VAR can only check for\nred-card offences.\n\nCallum Wilson's day was going from the sublime to the ridiculous and he was\nbooked for a dive in the box before Leicester put the game beyond his team with\na third.\n\nMaddison tried a clever stepover in the box to set up Vardy  but Mepham read\nthe danger and intercepted.\n\nIn keeping with the day, he then dallied and Maddison poked the ball away from\nhis toes to Tielemans, who slipped a pass to Vardy on his left.\n\nThe hitman, 32, applied the finish, drilling the ball home from close range.\n\nJob done and Bournemouth undone.\n\nHow boss Eddie Howe must now regret selling England new boy Mings to Villa.",

I am not sure I am a big lover of it.\"\n\nWinless Watford remain rock bottom  but are at least now off the mark.\n\nBoss Javi Gracia was under fire following six league losses in a row, three of\nwhich came at the end of last term.\n\nAnd the Spaniard had a good moan at officials at the end, but even he was not\ncertain if VAR got the call wrong.\n\nMATCH He said: \"Maybe when the ball is falling it touched his hand. But I didn't\nsee it.\"\n\nYou fear for Gracia's men in their next two games against Arsenal and City.\n\nNEWCASTLE 5/3.......Shots on/5................Blocked\n49%.............466..................6.....................2/0..........Yellow/red\nYet they got off to the perfect start here when Tom Cleverley was given time to\nfire off a 25-yard shot.

Very\nprofessional. Even with 11 men were the better team, although maybe we looked\nfor the killer pass too much.\n\n\"It's a big win. I've got a lot of time for Mark Cooper and the way his team\nplays.\"\n\nFGR came close to grabbing a point in the 75th minute when skipper Joseph Mills\ncurled a 25-yard freekick against the post.

Connor said: \"It's a defeat but we've\ngot to take the positives  apart from the two errors for the goals and the\nsending off!\n\n\"We have no problems with that and would've been screaming for a red card if it\nwas us.\"",

He's not the loudest but he leads by example and in time will be the\nfull-time captain of this club.\"\n\nWoodgate will have nightmares over the Bristol City's goals  both Kasey Palmer\nand Tommy Rowe heading home when unmarked.\n\nBoro's Ashley Fletcher poked a shot against a post while the Robins' Nathan\nBaker also hit an upright with a flicked header.\n\nBut delightful wing work by Niclas Eliasson left Paddy McNair for dead and his\ncross saw Palmer lose his marker to head City ahead.\n\nBoro found their rhythm after the break and equalised when McNair's cross was\ndiverted into his own net by Taylor Moore.\n\nBritt Assombalonga put the visitors ahead with his 100th league goal, and\nWoodgate added: \"I did think we were on our way to win.\"\n\nYet they fell asleep nine minutes from time and Rowe stooped to head home\nsubstitute Callum O'Dowda's cross.\n\nRobins head coach Lee Johnson said: \"I didn't enjoy it at all.

Taylor looked as if he was going for a\ncountry stroll instead of a run-up before coolly sending Cabral the wrong way\nfor his fifth goal this term.\n\nBowyer said: \"Our gameplan worked, our defence again stood strong and the keeper\ndid his job when called upon.\n\n\"The midfield lads have worked really, really hard to do the dirty side of the\ngame and the front two caused problems all day.\"\n\nJose Gomes defended his substitutions despite his Royals falling apart after.\n\nHe said: \"If you play games on the PlayStation, change the players and you lose,\nbut you can repeat the game. Here we can't.\"",

We expected this from him and he\ngelled straight away.\"\n\nBut Rovers needed just 23 seconds to break the deadlock. Kyle Bartley tried to\nplay out of defence to Romaine Sawyers  but it was intercepted by Lewis Travis.\n\nThe ball broke to Dack and he curled home a 15-yarder. Albion turned the game\naround with two goals in nine minutes, with Pereira involved in both.\n\nHis pass opened up a path for Phillips who shrugged off Greg Cunningham before\nslotting past Christian Walton on 22 minutes.\n\nThen Pereira teed up Livermore, who side-footed past Walton.\n\nGrady Diangana made it 3-1 five minutes before half-time.\n\nThe visitors were then handed a lifeline in first-half injury time.\n\nBaggies keeper Sam Johnstone failed to hold on to a header from Darragh Lenihan\n with Bradley Johnson gobbling up the loose ball.\n\nRovers boss Tony Mowbray felt Dack's second-half effort should not have been\nKO'd for a foul on Johnstone. He said: \"I'm not sure the ref could see it.\n\n\"He was looking through about nine players, he played it safe.\"\n\nMATCH STATS WEST BROM BLACKBURN 8/8.......Shots on/off target .......4/1\n5................Blocked shots................2 50% .............

As soon as the option was memorable day for him.\nHe's quiet but confident in his ability.\n\n\"It's difficult to say how far he can go when you have huge talent at such a\nyoung age. My priority is to protect him.\"\n\nStoke took the lead on 58 minutes through defender Liam Lindsay after Lee\nGregory hit the post.\n\nBut Clotet's side turned it around in the space of three minutes.\n\nFirst, Lukas Jutkiewicz met Maxime Colin's pinpoint cross to head the equaliser\nat the far post.\n\nAnd Bellingham fired the winner from the edge of the area, thanks to a big\ndeflection off Lindsay.\n\nIt left Stoke deflated and bottom of the table without a win.\n\nPotters boss Jones said: \"Nothing's going for us but we have to change our luck,\nthat's the frustrating thing.\n\n\"This cannot continue but I'm confident we can turn this around.\"\n\nMATCH STATS BIRMINGHAM STOKE 4/6.......Shots on/off target .......3/4\n2................Blocked shots................0 40% .............

            "content_plain": "As workplace bonds strengthen, you take a place in a team - even if it doesn't\nseem like the place you want to be. New sides of you begin to emerge and secret\nskills are uncovered. In love? A partnership moon opens two hearts to big\nchanges. Single? You'll find a new love interest is an expert in healthy eating.\n\nMake sure you find time for fun in the coming week. As your creativity revs up,\nyour unusual take on the world hits the right audience. Your work ideas are\ngenius - screens and dreams make a perfect match in more ways than one. As the\nplanets of passion and protection join, love finds a future-proof pattern.\n\nWalking on the lighter side of life restores emotional balance, so you'll be\nable to see who could be good for you. This week, power-planet bonds help you to\nreboot tricky partnerships. Meanwhile, your moon path is part \"just do it\", part\ndreamy, so people may not realise your strength until you end up in charge.\n\nYou will build brilliant bonds if you focus on communication. But be sure to\nalways stay true to yourself, so connections begin and stay genuine. Names that\nshare a special date are ready to start an important planning process. Your\nmemory zone is moon-intense and a significant journey is back on.\n\nHiding feelings, even for the best reasons, is not a solution to a problem.\nInstead, follow your heart and find a way to speak about emotions to reset a key\nrelationship. In the next few days, so much of your chart is about finding and\nrewarding value. This helps you overhaul everything, from love bonds to career\naims.\n\nYour chart shows a contrast between high-profile planets in your sign and the\ngentle moon lighting up how you feel and what to do about it - so you're the\ncentre of attention. A leading work role is perfect for you and you learn new\nskills super-fast. In love, going with the flow sets some big feelings free.\n\nStart September with clear decisions about cash, love or time. You have a new\nsense of belief in yourself, and a fresh vision for the future can appear. Luck\nsparkles around words, but you will also find it in how open you are to sharing\nyour dreams with others. In love, pure happiness links to an unexpected L name.\n\nThe people you surround yourself with matter so much right now, and instead of\nwaiting for a family member to call, you should make the first move. At work,\none group can become two and achieve more. A casual bond has the chance to\nbecome serious - but only if you switch off that doubting inner voice.\n\nYour success sector is shining with planet potential and you pursue goals with a\ndeep sense of purpose. Meanwhile, if you've been seeking approval in a\nrelationship, it's time to stop and set your own rules and limits for romance.\nYour Jupiter prize sensors are super-sharp, so you will select contests well.\n\nYour ability to learn in life and love tops all the zodiac signs in the coming\ndays. Intuition gives you a heads-up when making snap decisions or finalising\nkey documents, but best of all you find you won't be held back by the dreams or\nopinions of others. Meanwhile, a name heard several times is your best love\nclue.\n\nWhen you allow yourself to cut loose from tight schedules or expectations, you\nwill make time for something special. And yes, you'll be ready. At the moment\nyour growth and personal change is powered by the planets, which makes you the\nbest version of yourself. Saturn helps you stick to a secret promise.\n\nYou are ready to transform a part-time connection into something that sits\nfirmly in your favour. What may first feel like a problem develops into an\nexciting challenge. Numbers that start with seven and names that remind you of\nholidays are very lucky. Elsewhere, a caring moon leads you to a local charity.\n\nYOU CAN ALSO READ MYSTIC MEG IN FABULOUS",

Is it safe in the heat?\nAnd what precautions would you recommend?\" ASEAN SAYS: \"Most dogs love to go on\nholidays with their owners but you do need to be careful on your travels,\nespecially if it's hot.\n\n\"Ideally, have air con on in the car at all times, or windows rolled down for\nairflow - but not so much that Cornflake might jump out.\n\n\"Never leave her unattended in a parked car as dogs can overheat really fast.\nOffer her plenty of fresh, l t d i h ld cool water, and give her a cold, wet\ntowel to lie on, which will also help her keep cool. Ensure her passport is up\nto date with your vet before you travel.\n\n\"It's no fun if she's denied entry or can't travel back to the UK because her\nvaccinations and worming aren't up to date.\"\n\nQGLENN TODD, from Coventry, is finally going to give in and let her son Sean\nhave a pet. She says: \"He wants a snake - which I don't. He is seven and I know\nI'll end up looking after it. Are snakes a good idea in a house? Are they easy\nto look after?\" ASEAN SAYS: \"Snakes can be good pets but they need specialist\ncare, food, expensive housing and heating equipment and are very long lived - up\nto 25 years for 'beginner' species.\n\n\"This is unusual but I'd suggest stick insects or giant African land snails.\n\n\"A pet mouse or hamster could also work, with plenty of adult supervision and\nhelp. Pets are a great way to teach kids responsibility and empathy, but it's\nvital to match difficulty level with the child's expectations and abilities.\n\n\"Maybe you'll allow him to have a snake when he's a teenager if he's still\nfascinated by pets and animals and adamant he'll take care of one.\"",

            "content_plain": "OWNERS who struggle to care for their dogs when the kids go back to school are\nbeing urged NOT to hand them over to rescue centres.\n\nRehoming charity Dogs Trust says it has seen an alarming trend in young dogs\nbeing abandoned in August and September, following the school holidays.\n\nLast year, it saw a 12 per cent increase in pets being given up at the end of\nthe summer.\n\nThe average age was just three and a half.\n\nOften, being around children for six weeks can lead to behaviour problems as\npets struggle to adapt to the change in their home environment.\n\nA Dogs Trust spokeswoman says: \"Sadly, in the past we have seen spikes in the\nnumber of people returning their dogs to us after the summer holidays, when\ntheir dog struggles to adjust to the new routine, or because they were only\npurchased to keep children entertained over the summer break.\n\n\"Dogs can make a wonderful addition to a family, but it's a decision which\nshouldn't be taken lightly. Having a pet is a lifetime commitment, and potential\nowners should think carefully about the reality of dog ownership and whether it\nis suitable for their lifestyle.\n\n\"We hope people thinking of adopting one will remember that a dog is for life,\nnot just the summer holidays.\"\n\nThe charity offers these tips: l CONSIDER how your dog's daily routine will\nchange when school starts. They may get less attention than they are used to, or\nbe left alone for longer.\n\nGradually introducing these changes in advance will help your dog adjust better\nto their new routine.\n\nl DOGS are social, intelligent and active animals, so it is important to\nexercise their bod-ies and minds. Make sure your dog has plenty to keep it\noccupied, such as interactive puzzlefeeders, safe chews and their own toys made\nfrom a variety of materials.\n\nl YOU might also want to consider asking a friend or dog walker to pop in if\nyour dog is going to be left by itself for longer periods.\n\nl SOME dogs might find the school run overwhelming, as there are likely to be\nlots of unfamiliar adults, children, noises and other dogs around.\n\nThink about walking your dog at other times of the day, when it is a bit quieter\noutside and there is less going on.\n\nOwners who feel they need professional help can take part in Dog School, a\ntraining programme set up by the charity in the hope that it will keep families\ntogether and stop pets being handed in.\n\nlFind out more at dogschool.org.uk",

Not only did they invent the electric\nlight bulb and the bicycle, they also discovered the joys of the British seaside\n ensuring their towels got prime spots before any German tourists could think\ntwice.\n\nAnd you can see why.\n\nThere is so much to do on a holiday beside the sea.\n\nWhether it be on the front surrounded by old-fashioned beach huts, piers\nreaching out into the blue, crazy-golf courses, quaint little ports or modern\nwaterside parks.\n\nWe stayed at Hoburne Devon Bay caravan park, nestled on the hill above Paignton\nin Torbay, on the stretch of coast known as the English Riviera.\n\nOur two-room caravan was spotless and a good size for the four of us. There was\none en-suite, another bathroom and big kitchen diner living room with sofa bed,\nwith decking outdoors.\n\nThe park itself is medium-sized with a huge number of amenities  indoor pool\nwith waterslides, massive outdoor pool and sunbathing area, adventure\nplayground, cafe, restaurant, main entertainment area, shop, launderette and\nfootball pitches.\n\nA 15-minute stroll away is the charming beach of Goodrington Sands. As well as\nthe red-hued sands, there is the fabulous Splashdown Quaywest waterpark  and a\nleisure centre with closed-circuit cycle track open to the public and bike hire\navailable.\n\nThere's also a steam train running along the coast, a local zoo, the English\nRiviera Ferris wheel, gokarts, amusement arcades plus loads of walks and trails.\n\nDelicious rewards Despite it being high season, the park never seemed too busy.\n\nAnd you could spend your entire holiday on the park or use it as a base for\nexploring the area.\n\nMy dance skills leave a lot to be desired so we gave the bingo and dancefloor a\nswerve but there's a full programme of evening events.\n\nInstead, we opted for busy days and cosy nights in on the sofa.\n\nThere was a lovely hike along the South West Coast Path to the nearby fishing\nport of Brixham, discovering ancient woodlands and the almosthidden coves of\nElberry and Churston  where we went for a dip to cool down. The swim was\nfollowed by the delicious fish and chips  and a bus back to base.\n\nNext day our adventure took us back to Elberry Cove, where we spent the day on\nthe shingle dipping in and out of the clear water and getting up close and\npersonal with schools of fish and a friendly seal who happily bobbed about, just\n15ft from the shore.\n\nAlthough those Victorians were clever they couldn't master the weather. We had\nthree glorious days, one mediocre and one terrible.\n\nBut there is so much to do, both on the park and in the surrounding area, it\nreally is the Great British Holiday the weather cannot ruin.\n\nALEX COHEN GO: DEVON STAYING THERE: A three-night weekend break at Hoburne Devon\nBay in a holiday caravan or lodge is from £179, and seven nights is from £669.\nCaravan touring pitches are from £105 for three nights. Dog friendly\naccommodation is also available. See hoburne.com.",

            "content_plain": "CHILDREN are heading back to school - but they are not learning the vital lesson\nof how to manage their money. Youngsters are less familiar with cash due to\nseeing their parents pay by card all the time, a study by University College\nLondon's Institute of Education has found.\n\nIt has left them struggling with basic tasks such as working out how much they\nshould pay when at a shop checkout and how much change they should get.\n\nResearcher Dr Jennie Golding, is \"shocked\" by the findings, and warns a lack of\nfinancial knowhow could add to Britain's growing debt crisis.\n\nSignificant problem In one primary school, seven and eight-year-olds were using\nplastic coins to work out their shopping total and change due.\n\nHalf of the class had \"significant difficulty\", as they were unfamiliar with the\nuse of coins, different combinations of values, or the notion of \"change\".\n\nHer observations in a secondary school classroom found none of the teens were\ngetting pocket money or working part-time.\n\nIf they went shopping, they were given money or their parents would pay \nusually by card. When the teacher showed one class of 14 and 15-year-olds a\nspreadsheet for her monthly budget, students showed no understanding of taxes or\nloans such as mortgages  describing them as a \"rip-off\".\n\nDr Golding says: \"There's already a significant problem with debt in this\ncountry. And those struggling with it will have been brought up handling money h\nth t much more than youngsters today do. My concern is that the problem will\nescalate and we'll have more people not able to manage their money effectively \nand struggling with increased poverty as a result.\"\n\nThe same issues are continuing into later life.\n\nA separate study by UCL Institute of Education and the University of Cambridge\nfound one in three adults in England and Northern Ireland is incapable of\nworking out the correct change when shopping. While four in ten struggle to\nunderstand when a simple discount is applied to an everyday product.\n\nProfessor John Jerrim, also f th I tit t f of the UCL Institute of Education,\nsays: \"The research highlighted how England is facing a crisis in terms of\nadults' financial literacy skills.\"\n\nJamie Smith-Thompson, of pensions advice specialist Portafina, says: \"The sooner\nchildren start learning about money and the role it plays in our lives, the\nbetter equipped they will be when it comes to managing their finances as an\nadult.\"\n\nTo help get the kids thinking about money and how it works, here are some\ntalking points for each age group and a quiz for the teens and grown-ups.\n\nlQuiz devised by Portafina, KickStart Money, MyBnk and Young Money\n\nAT this stage it is about making the connection that the things we need and want\ncost money. So to get these things, we need to earn money and save it, too. TALK\nABOUT l Where does money come from? l What do we use money for? l How do we get\nmore money? l What happens if you save money? GET them to understand that money\nis precious and that is does not grow on trees. It is also about grasping the\nfact that different things cost different amounts of money, which is why savings\nare so important. TALK ABOUT l What type of things do parents and grown-ups have\nto spend their money on each month? l On average, how much do people earn a\nyear? l Think of the one thing you really want - how much does it cost? l How\nlong would it take you to save up and buy it? THE crucial, final building block\n- understanding some spending is essential and some isn't, and being able to\nbalance between your needs and wants. TALK ABOUT l How much does it cost your\nparents to run your home? l Can you list all of the monthly essentials and guess\nhow much each of them cost? l You want something but can't afford it - what\nshould you do? l If you were paid £10 a week, what would you do with it? AGED 5\n- 7 Understanding concept of money AGED 8 - 11 Understanding value of money AGED\n16 - ADULT They should be ready BUT even adults struggle with basic concepts.\nHere are grown-up questions to test your knowledge. (Answers below) QUIZ 1.\nExplain the advantage of compound interest compared to simple interest. 2. Which\nof these is better for a saver - an account which calculates interest daily,\nmonthly or yearly? 3. Do you know what your personal savings allowance is? 4.\nExplain the difference between APR and AER. 5. What does the term PAYE stand\nfor? 6. Explain the difference between a standing order and a direct debit. 1.\nCompound interest means you get interest on interest. 2. Daily calculation is\nbetter for a saver. 3. The personal savings allowance means a basic-rate\ntaxpayer (20 per cent tax on income) can earn £1,000 interest on savings per tax\nyear without paying tax on it. 4. The interest rate you receive when you save\nmoney in an account is known as the Annual Equivalent Rate (AER). The Annual\nPercentage Rate (APR) is what you are charged for borrowing products. Both take\ninto account any fees and charges. 5. Pay As You Earn. This is how most\nemployees pay tax. It is deducted by the employer before you see it. 6. With a\nstanding order, you instruct your bank to pay the money to a particular person\nor company. It is your responsibility to change the payment details (eg, the\ndate or amount) if they need to be changed. A direct debit is an instruction to\nyour bank to release money from your account to pay amounts automatically - the\nbilling company has control rather than you.

It is possible all three sensors will work together to\ndeliver high-resolution images. FRONT CAMERA IMPROVED: The selfie camera,\nalready good on the iPhone, will go from 7MP to 12MP. This will be on all the\nnew iPhone models.\n\nNEW FACE ID: The facial recognition capability of the next iPhone will work\nacross a wider angle, so you can unlock it by looking at it even when it is\nlying flat on the table, for instance. TWO-WAY CHARGING: The next iPhone will\nfeature, on some models, wireless charging that works in two directions. So if\nyour friend's phone is running low, holding it to the iPhone will recharge it.\n\nFASTER CHIP: The A13 chip to be in the new iPhone will be even faster and more\npowerful than current models. This will make more complicated apps possible,\nsuch as advanced augmented reality effects where the camera's view is overlaid\nwith items from online. Think Pokémon Go on steroids. WHAT ELSE?: The price is\nlikely to be the same as last year's models (currently from £749 for the iPhone\nXR, from £999 for the iPhone XS). And it looks like there'll be a more powerful\ncharger in the box, so recharging will be much faster. THE RIVALS Samsung Galaxy\nS10+, from £799, samsung.com: This is a fast phone that is a real pleasure to\nuse. Solid software, gorgeous design and excellent cameras. It has two-way\ncharging and a fingerprint sensor buried in the screen itself.\n\nHuawei P30 Pro, £899, john lewis.com: The best camera phone on the market, bar\nnone, thanks to its brilliant multiple Leica lenses and clever artificial\nintelligence software that does a lot of work to make your shots look great.\n\nOppo Reno 10x Zoom, £699.99 from carphonewarehouse.com: Chinese brand Oppo is\nthe one that's nudged Apple out of the top three status with phones like this\nhandset with triple cameras. One of the cameras uses a periscope design where\nthe light is reflected along the inside of the phone for a telephoto effect.",

            "content_plain": "IN his department-store blazer, checking the time on his thirty-dollar watch,\nDavid Boies looks like any other New York City businessman.\n\nYet this is the \"superstar litigator\" with Prince Andrew in his sights over\nallegations linked to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThose who know Boies told The Sun on Sunday the lawyer, 78, would make\n\"mincemeat\" of Andrew if he gets to formally question the prince over the\nEpstein scandal.\n\nBoies, who charges £1,500 an HOUR for his services, is the man Epstein's alleged\n\"sex slave\" Virginia Roberts Giuffre has turned to.\n\nHe has been nicknamed \"the Michael Jordan of the courtroom\" and \"the Tiger Woods\nof the legal world\".\n\nBoies represented former US Vice President Al Gore when he sued George W Bush\nover the disputed 2000 presidential election.\n\nThe year before, he beat Microsoft in a landmark competition case in which the\njudge ordered the IT giant split into two companies.\n\nBoies' memory has been likened to a human hard drive as he can pluck obscure\nfacts from decades ago to bolster his legal arguments.\n\nHe is known to conduct multiple phone calls at the same time and his superhuman\nwork ethic is famous. He once asked a colleague: \"Would you rather sleep ... or\nwin?\" He is also known for his ego and has said: \"I win virtually every case I\nshould win and I win a number of cases people think I shouldn't.\"\n\nBoies was born in Illinois, to teacher parents. He would memorise stories read\nto him by his mother as dyslexia meant Boies could not read them himself.\n\n'If he says a case isn't going away, it isn't' Because of that dyslexia, he\nspeaks in court without notes. He has kept his Midwestern accent, and some say\njuries relate better to him as a result.\n\nHe steers clear of using long words and legal jargon, giving him a disarming\nstyle in court in even the most complex of cases.\n\nHe wears suits from department store Macy's and has a basic watch, but some of\nhis tastes are much more extravagant.\n\nHe is fond of Las Vegas and has blown £8,000 in a single weekend. But Boies\ninsists he never gambles \"amounts of money that make any difference to me\".\n\nHis wine collection is not humble, either. The cellar at his mansion north of\nNew York City is large enough for 8,000 bottles.\n\nNo wonder, given he owns a vineyard in California, the State where he had a\nbreakthrough win in court to back same-sex marriage. He owns a ranch and a\nyacht.\n\nFather to six children by three women, he loves to be seen on the Manhattan\nsocial circuit with his third wife Mary, 69, a lawyer.\n\nBut he has experienced tragedy too. His son Jonathan  also a lawyer  died this\nyear, aged 50.\n\nAnd his reputation took a battering when he represented shamed movie producer\nHarvey Weinstein in 2017.\n\nNow his firm is acting for Ms Roberts and a number of Epstein's other alleged\nvictims pro bono  meaning for free.\n\nSome have even described this case as Boies' shot at redemption, though he has\nlaughed off the suggestion.\n\nBoies has made \"multiple requests\" to interview Andrew and this week said he was\nconsidering legal action pressing the royal to give evidence under oath.\n\nUS solicitor Daniel Bibb, who was a Manhattan prosecutor for 20 years, said\nAndrew, 59, faces a daunting adversary.\n\nHe told The Sun on Sunday: \"David leaves no stone unturned and has a legal team\nwho are about as good as he is. If David goes out there and tells Prince Andrew\nthis case isn't going away, you can take it to the bank it isn't going\nanywhere.\"\n\nBoies was seen outside Manhattan's federal court this week with Ms Roberts, 36.\n\nShe claims she was forced to have sex three times with Prince Andrew when she\nwas 17  at an \"orgy in London\", at Epstein's home and at an \"orgy\" on his\nprivate island in the Caribbean.\n\nAndrew was friends with the pervert for more than a decade. Epstein killed\nhimself in jail last month, while facing sex-trafficking charges.\n\nThe royal strenuously denied \"having any form of sexual contact or relationship\"\nwith Ms Roberts but questions remain about his behaviour and his frequent visits\nto Epstein's questions homes. Now Andrew may be forced to answer those\nquestions. This week, 16 of Epstein's alleged victims were given the chance to\ntell their harrowing stories in court.\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Ms Roberts urged the prince to \"come clean\" and\nsaid: \"He knows what he's done.\"\n\nBoies stuck the knife in, adding: \"Anybody can deny things in a printed\nstatement.\n\n\"It's a different thing to come here and answer questions under oath, subject to\ncross-examination.\n\n\"Those are the kinds of answers we are eventually going to get.\"\n\nMark Bederow, a New York defence lawyer, said: \"Boies is dogged and known for\nhis brilliant legal acumen.\n\n\"He is an experienced, highly respected litigator. I would say he is in the top\ntier of lawyers in America. He's top-notch, for sure.\"\n\nBoies began his career at Cravath Swaine & Moore, arguably the most respected\nlaw firm in America, with a raft of wealthy and powerful clients.\n\n'Dyslexia forced him to work twice as hard' By 31, he had become the firm's\nyoungest partner.\n\nIn 1997, he left to set up his own firm, Boies Schiller Flexner.\n\nColleagues thought he was mad to leave such a good job.\n\nBut within an hour of the news breaking, he had his first client  DuPont, the\nchemical giant.\n\nHe came into the public eye by representing Al Gore before the US Supreme Court\nin the 2000 presidential recount controversy.\n\nBoies  like Gore, a Democrat  suffered a rare reversal and would afterwards\nadmit: \"I lost the whole f*****g country.\"\n\nBut he won a blockbuster antitrust case against Microsoft on behalf of the US\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nSo confident was Boies that on the eve of taking a key deposition from Microsoft\nfounder Bill Gates, he threw aside his briefing notes and relaxed by watching\nthe Kevin Costner film Tombstone.\n\nBoies still won the case. Boies fought off a libel suit brought against telly\nnetwork CBS by US Army general William Westmoreland, making himself a champion\nof the free Press in the process.\n\nAnd he has been feted in the pages of Time magazine and the New York Times.\n\nJoe Patrice, a senior editor at legal mag Above The Law, has met Boies several\ntimes and talks of his \"stellar\" reputation.\n\nPatrice said: \"He is very analytical and, due to his dyslexia, has had to work\ntwice as hard at things.\n\n\"That has contributed to his mindset where he works through things methodically.\n\n\"If David Boies sets his sights on you  especially in a case like this, where\nmoney is not an object  you need to worry.\n\n\"Your hope is that the client stops paying. But here that's not going to happen,\ns pursue it so he's going to doggedly it.\" Boies was criticised for defending\nHarvey Weinstein, 67, over the abuse claims that sparked the #MeToo campaign.\n\nHe hit back by saying everyone had a right to be defended and has pointed out\nthat his firm had represented Weinstein for years before the claims surfaced.\n\nHe was even branded a \"thug\" for trying to shut down a story about a biotech\nfirm that collapsed amid allegations of massive fraud.\n\nEither way, Boies' clients know one thing. He will give them his all.\n\nAs his fellow lawyer Mark Bederow said: \"When an attorney like David Boies says\nhe's coming for you, you can assume he's coming for you.\"\n\nl sundayfeatures@the-sun.co.uk",

On the upside, this has\nprompted some MPs to call for an inquiry about how our annual foreign aid budget\n- around £14billion - is spent.\n\nOn the downside, this is an example of yet more foreign aid money that has\nfallen into the wrong hands and ended up being wasted.\n\nIn the meantime, British schools are crying out for investment.\n\nSo why are we spending money on Pakistani schools and not our own? Meanwhile, in\nthe UK, overseas patients have left the NHS with more than £150million in unpaid\nbills for treatment, it emerged this week. That cash could pay for 6,000 nurses,\n22,000 heart bypasses or nearly 5,500 junior doctors.\n\nTwo London hospitals are owed £28million each, including almost £500,000 from\none patient alone.\n\nApparently staff are reluctant to chase payments, with doctors' leaders saying\ntheir obligation to charge overseas patients is \"racist\" and deters vulnerable\ngroups from seeking help.\n\nTo me, that sounds completely bonkers.\n\nI don't understand why you are not asked to produce your NHS number - we all\nhave one - when you get to hospital.\n\nEvery other country asks, so why not us? It's a national service, not an\ninternational one.",

            "content_plain": "GIVEN the alarming rise in mental health issues in young people, this week's\nnews that children are the unhappiest they have been for almost 25 years is no\nsurprise.\n\nAlmost a quarter of a million kids in the UK  around 219,000  report being\nunhappy with their lives as a whole, according to The Children's Society.\n\nThis is partly due to increasing loneliness and turbulent friendships. And guess\nwhat has been highlighted by charity experts as the main cause? \"Excessive\nsocial media use.\" Anyone surprised by that either? Thought not. Of course, not\nall children are unhappy. But parents should take this news as a serious warning\nshot. Because when it comes to our children's happiness, the trend is clearly\ngoing in the wrong direction.\n\nWith social media, the problem is partly one of expectations.\n\nMost grown-ups are seasoned enough to take the inevitable \"my perfect life\"\nposts on Instagram with a pinch of salt.\n\nBut if you are new to these things, being bombarded with images on your mate's\nInstagram page of the life you are \"meant\" to be living could make even the most\nsecure children begin to feel inadequate.\n\nThe other problem is that it's always \"on\"  and so are our kids.\n\nIt used to be that children could shut the front door on a day of school and\nleave it on the outside until morning. Now, though, there is 24-hour access.\n\nAnother news story this week revealed that nine out of ten teens aren't getting\nenough sleep or exercise. It doesn't take a genius to link the two issues.\n\nSocial media  and reality TV  also reveal a new emphasis on appearance that\nhas changed so much in the past 25 years, for adults as well as children. It's\njust that children are more susceptible to that pressure.\n\nOther things have changed too  not least our approach to parenting (which\nwasn't even a word 25 years ago). We are much more child-focused, which isn't a\nbad thing necessarily.\n\nBut telling our kids they are the best, no matter what they do, risks them\nthinking they are the best without doing anything at all to be so.\n\nYes, we can help boost our children's self-esteem. But what we should really do\nis help them boost their own self-esteem by doing things that make them feel\ngood about themselves.\n\nObviously, more families now have two parents in the workplace. That is a good\nthing but perhaps some working parents feel the need to compensate for their\nabsence in ways  such as too many screens and \"treats\"  that aren't\nnecessarily brilliant for their children's mental health.\n\nI write as a mother of two who worked more or less throughout my children's\nyoung lives.\n\nI'm proud to say we all made it through in one piece.\n\nObviously, I am no parenting expert. And I'm not claiming to have the answer to\nthe world's ills.\n\nBut over the years, I've identified three golden rules I believe build a\nfoundation for happy kids.\n\nThe first is sport. I passionately believe that being part of a team, having\nregular exercise, being out and about and maintaining a routine offers kids\nstability and boundaries.\n\nIt helps children feel good about their bodies and their abilities, boosting\ntheir self-esteem.\n\nThe second is friendship. I am talking about proper friendship  not Facebook\n\"friends\" you never meet. When kids leave their phones at home and develop real\nfriendships, they find people they can talk to and have fun with Never\nunderestimate the importance of fun.\n\nThe third golden rule is probably the most important.\n\nKeep talking.\n\nThere are too many tragic examples recently of young people who felt it\nnecessary to take their own lives.\n\nI believe a problem shared is a problem halved.\n\nNo matter how bad something is, talking always helps.\n\nI don't remember ever reading about suicide when I was younger  especially not\nsuicide in young people. Now it is the biggest cause of death among people aged\n20 to 34 and it affects three times more men than women.\n\nThat is a scary statistic. The causes are complicated but we need to keep\nchannels of communication open with our kids. That way, if they are unhappy, we\nwill know about it.\n\nAnd if we know about it, we at least have the potential to help.\n\nA problem shared is a problem halved",

So Alfie was off the hook.\n\nThat should have left him with the feeling that he had dodged a bullet.\n\nIt could have spurred him on towards getting a good education and a job, to\nbuilding himself a future.\n\nThe adults in his life should have encouraged him to do just that.\n\nInstead, this week he turned up at Lewes Crown Court to be sentenced after being\nconvicted of criminal damage.\n\nThe court heard he is now a jobless alcoholic who lives at home with his mother\nand has a history of criminal offences.\n\nHe already had a 24-month suspended prison sentence hanging over his head after\nbeing convicted on June 14 of shoplifting, theft and possession of an imitation\nfirearm.\n\nThis is a good reminder that suspended sentences do not work. Alfie Patten\nclearly needs a bigger wake-up call than a suspended sentence or he risks ending\nup dead from alcohol and drugs.\n\nI saw a bench in my local park the other day that said: \"Die with memories ...\nnot dreams.\"\n\nSo true.

Fares are from £7pp.\n\nSiam Park has benefited in recent years from huge investment, which has seen it\nnearly double in size.\n\nThe new Coco Beach has a monster wave pool with hundreds of loungers, plus rides\nsuch as Patong Rapids and the Singha water-rollercoaster, on which you can hit\nspeeds of up to 40mph while in a dinghy. The VIP experience has been ramped up,\ntoo. Guests can now book their own private area with Balinese beds in the\nChampagne Club  or a villa with jacuzzi, TV, minibar and hammocks.\n\nNo wonder so many people flock to the park every year to bask in the sun, which\nshines year-round. Even in October and November temperatures average around 26C.\n\nI took my wife and three young children and the hours of wet-andwild fun flew\nby.\n\nTigers and pandas My two daughters, aged six and nine, were absorbed by The Lost\nCity  think kids' TV favourite Fun House on water, mercifully with no Pat\nSharp.\n\nMeanwhile, my 11-month-old son played with the water guns and explored the\nminislides in the baby pool. I shared in the excitement of the water rides, too.\nMany have a minimum rider height of 1.1 metres so four of us could go on\ntogether  like on the Naga Racer ride where we raced each other, face-first, on\nmats.\n\nDon't worry, family-friends looked after the baby.\n\nFaster rides have a minimum rider height of 1.25 metres. If you fancy taking on\nthe Tower of Power you need to be at least 1.4 metres, aged 14 or over and not\ntoo scared of heights.\n\nYou hit speeds of up to 50mph, while guides order you to keep your head down at\nall times and arms crossed across your chest.\n\nIt is so fast you barely open your eyes, so you miss the sharks in the water\ntank as they pass by in a flash  unlike those watching from the viewing balcony\nbelow.\n\nIf waterparks are not your thing, head to the north of the island for the\nbeautiful Loro Parque, on the outskirts of Puerto de la Cruz, which has been\nvisited by more than 50million people since it opened in 1972.\n\nOpposite steak restaurant Brunelli's  well worth a visit to break up your day \nthe zoo is a real treat for nature lovers.\n\nThe 33-acre site is home to animals including chimps, lions, hippos, tigers and\nred pandas, while also housing an impressive number of reptiles and birds.\n\nMaking your way through an ice tunnel, you can see four species of penguin in an\nincredible replica of their Antarctic habitat.\n\nLoro Parque is also famous for its sea-life shows, with dolphins regularly\nsoaking those sitting in the first few rows.\n\nWhatever park you choose, you will leave sopping-wet ... but with a huge smile\non your face.\n\nSTUART PINK GO: TENERIFE GETTING THERE: Flights to from the UK to Tenerife are\nfrom £30.99 one way. See easyJet.com.\n\nOUT & ABOUT: Twin tickets to Siam Park & Loro Parque are from £41.27 for kids\nand from £59.87 per adult. See tickets.siampark.net/gb.",

But there is a better way.\n\nF1 Experiences offers fans track tours, pit and paddock access, hospitality and\ndriver meet-andgreets. Packages also include tickets for Saturday practice days\nand races on Sunday.\n\nI saw Lewis Hamilton win a record-breaking sixth British Grand Prix at\nSilverstone in July.\n\nWith the Hero package, I got to ride around the circuit on the same flatbed\ntruck the drivers use for their pre-parade lap.\n\nWith expert guidance from former drivers, you learn the right line to take\nthrough the famous Luffield and Brooklands corners.\n\nIt made for the perfect start to my weekend.\n\nBack at the main grandstand, you get a photo with the trophy before enjoying a\nguided tour of the pit lane.\n\nIt is incredible to see the mechanics working feverishly away at 10pm. They are\nso dedicated to their work, F1 chiefs had to impose a 1am curfew so they would\nget a few hours' kip.\n\nAfter Friday's practice sessions, there were more unforgettable experiences\nlined up.\n\nFirst up was a reception in the magnificent Paddock Club on the top tier of\nSilverstone's new main stand, which also included an entertaining Q&A session\nwith driver Lando Norris.\n\nStill only 19, Lando has been handed another year's deal by his McLaren-Renault\nteam.\n\nFrom there, we have a look inside the drivers' cooldown room, where the top\nthree are weighed before venturing out on to the podium.\n\nWe got to stand on the same step as Hamilton did 48 hours before he celebrated\nin front of 141,000 delirious home fans.\n\nIt was back down to the pit lane again for a four-stop tour that included a\nbrilliant chat with famed safety-car driver Bernd Maylander, whose Mercedes AMG\nGT road car manages to roar around at 150mph. (Well, you wouldn't want to hold\nup the traffic behind and let their tyres get cold.) Much is made of tyres in\nF1. So, in the Pirelli pit, an ex-driver gets you to touch the soft (red), the\nyellow (medium) and the hard (white) tyres to feel the difference in smoothness\nof the rubber, plus the unique tread on the wetweather version if there is a\ndownpour. You just cannot get your head around how those pit crew can get four\nchanged in around two seconds!\n\nSaturday - qualifying day - was deservedly spent feet up being wined and dined\nat The Champions Club, watching all the action from the terrace of Silverstone's\nUniversity Technical College plus a special-guest visit from McLaren chief Zac\nBrown.\n\nIt was the perfect spot to see Hamilton battle it out for pole position with his\nMercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas as they hared out of Woodcote corner on to the\nold pit, straight before taking on Copse corner as if they were on a high-speed\nrail.\n\nTo cap it all, fans can also get an amazing walk down the paddock - access\nusually reserved for the drivers, team officials and select VIPs. And it was a\ngreat chance to spot celebrities. My list included Bond star Daniel Craig,\nrapper Will.i.am and 2009 F1 world champion Jenson Button.\n\nMy outlook as a fan has changed for ever - and I will watch future F1 races in a\nwhole new light.\n\nLEE SMITH",

When The Sun caught up with Fadi at\nhis Travelodge hideaway, he bizarrely denied being the late Wham! star's ex.\n\nLebanese Fadi, whose pals have previously begged him to seek mental health\ntreatment, said: \"I'm not Fadi. Sorry to disappoint you.\n\n\"It's so tragic what happened to George. It's a terrible loss. But I don't\nreally know him. In fact I've never met him.\"\n\nFadi also claimed he was not staying at the hotel, merely using its lobby to\ncharge his mobile. But sources confirmed he had been there for \"several weeks\"\nand was checked in until September 9. It is a huge comedown for Fadi, who was\nnot left anything in George's £97.6million will following his December 2016\ndeath. He had lived at George's home ever since, despite the star's family\nwanting him out.\n\nThe Travelodge, with rooms as cheap as £49 a night, has received mixed reviews\nonline.\n\nr cri la cleanlin Guests have criticised the size of rooms, the lack of\nfacilities and the cleanliness of carpets, bedding and towels.

            "content_plain": "MUTINOUS MPs face having their Commons passes deactivated to stop them staging a\nsit-in to block Brexit.\n\nIt is among a range of measures open to security chiefs to stop this week's\ndebates descending into chaos. Officials fear some will resort to desperate\naction as feelings run high over Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament.\n\nSome MPs have secretly discussed occupying the Commons in defiance of the\nQueen's decision to halt sittings from next Monday temporarily.\n\nAny votes taken would only be binding if the mace  symbol of the monarch's\nauthority and kept by pro-Remain Speaker John Bercow  is in the chamber. But\ncontingency plans have been drawn up by security officials to cover every\neventuality, including a threat to bust prorogation.\n\nOne option discussed was to deactivate the Parliamentary passes which MPs and\npeers must swipe to gain entrance to the estate.\n\nA source said: \"There would be merry hell if we did it but senior officials have\na plan for every eventuality - including the craziest scenarios. There was a\nfebrile atmosphere about the place before the recess but we suspect many will be\nfired up for a battle when they return on Tuesday.\"\n\nMPs will try to seize control of the Parliamentary agenda on Tuesday  and then\nram through a new law forcing the PM to delay Brexit unless he can strike a deal\nwith the EU.\n\nBut Brexit-backers will attempt to talk out the move by staging long-winded\ndebates and raising points of order during its passage through the Commons and\nthe Lords. Their idea is to run down the clock before the five-week suspension\nof proceedings begins.\n\nOnce Parliament has been prorogued, sittings can only resume in the event of the\nmonarch's death, war or a national emergency, such as an earthquake or disease\noutbreak. A \"rabble alliance\" of anti-Brexit MPs have discussed holding sittings\noutside of Parliament. Security teams have had extra briefings and staff advised\nto remove passes as they leave to avoid being harangued by demonstrators.\n\nLabour MP Hilary Benn has emerged as the latest choice by an all-party group of\nRemainers to lead a new government of \"national unity\". But Jeremy Corbyn still\nbelieves he should be the man to take charge if the PM is forced aside.\n\ndavid.wooding@the-sun.co.uk The Sun on Sunday Says  Page 16",

            "content_plain": "htes A BRUNETTE pictured with Wayne Rooney in a hotel at 5.30am has told how he\nearlier stripped to his pants in front of three women at a boozy Jacuzzi party.\n\nt tl erl gse Karra Granados, seen in last week's Sun getting in a hotel lift\nwith Rooney, said the ex-England skipper and four DC United team-mates all\nstripped to their skivvies during a wild seven-hour night out.\n\ne Karra, 27, said: \"Wayne took off his jeans and was dipping his feet in the\nwater. He joined in with everyone else. He had tight boxers on  they were blue\nand I think they were Calvin Klein.'' She also told how Rooney and one team-mate\ntook her back to their hotel at 5.30am after the Jacuzzi party ended  where the\nManchester United legend fell asleep and she romped with his friend.\n\nKarra added: \"It was a crazy night  Wayne partied so hard with the others. It\nwas very intense. Everyone was going for it and Wayne was definitely letting his\nhair down, joining in with everybody. He was in very good spirits.\n\n\"I think Wayne just wanted to feel like a normal guy on a night out, not a\nfamous person.\"\n\nKarra told how she hooked up with Rooney, 33, and team-mates following a DC\nUnited match in Vancouver on August 17.\n\nShe was with friends at nightclub Twelve West when they were given a VIP table\nnext to Rooney's group.\n\nShe said she poked fun at Rooney because he looked scruffy in a grey hoodie and\nbaseball cap.\n\nKarra said: \"I wasn't really paying attention to his party. But I almost spilled\na drink on one of them and we began chatting.\n\n\"I had no idea who Wayne Rooney was but someone mentioned that he was a famous\nfootballer.\"\n\nWhile in the club Rooney, believed to be drinking rum and cokes, was pictured\ndeep in conversation with a second woman  a brunette wearing black leather\ntrousers. Pictures showed him putting his arms around her waist and her leaning\nin closely to whisper in his ear.\n\nRooney later insisted the woman was \"simply one of many who innocently asked for\nautographs\".\n\nKarra, who did not know the woman, said: \"They looked like they were quite\nclose, she was flirtatious.\n\n\"I didn't see her getting his autograph.\" Karra's account of that night fills in\na few details that Rooney omitted when he responded angrily on social media to\nThe Sun's story.\n\nShe told how the woman in the a te an Pierre's Champ picture was asked to join\nher, Rooney and team-mates as they headed to another club, called Champagne\nLounge. After they all clambered into a limo, Rooney turned his attention\ntowards lawyer's assistant Karra.\n\nShe said: \"Wayne's team-mate grabbed me by the hand and put me in the limo.\n\n\"He was pushing everyone in but there wasn't much room. Wayne said 'Come and sit\nhere next to me'.\n\n\"He put his arm around me.\n\nThe other girl was on the other side of the limo.\"\n\nOnce in Pierre's the other woman disappeared  and Karra found herself as the\nonly girl on Rooney's table as waiters brought them drinks.\n\nAfter about an hour Karra, Rooney, two other women and four team-mates were\ninvited back to a barman's apartment.\n\nIt had a shared swimming pool and a Jacuzzi  which the group ended up using in\nthe early hours of the morning. Karra told how Rooney whipped off his jeans,\nrevealing blue Calvin Klein underpants, and dipped his legs into the water of\nthe Jacuzzi.\n\nHis team-mates also stripped to their underwear.\n\nThe two other women, friends of the barman, swam in the adjacent pool. Karra\nsaid: \"Wayne joined in with everyone else. He had tight boxers on.\n\n\"He kept his shirt on but his jeans got wet when they were laid out beside the\nhot tub.\n\n\"When he put them back on it looked like he had p***** him-himself. I was making\nfun of him about it.\"\n\nAt about 5.30am Rooney and one of his team-mates invited Karra with them back to\ntheir hotel, the Hyatt Regency.\n\nShe said: \"We went up in the lift together and all chatted for a bit. Then\nWayne, who just seemed absolutely exhausted, went to sleep.\"\n\nKarra said she ended up kissing and cuddling the team-mate. She added: \"I moved\nover to his bed and we kissed.\n\n\"I was really tired so later I called a cab and went home.\"\n\nKarra said she was devastated when she discovered the player she kissed was\nmarried.\n\nShe added: \"Nothing would have happened between us if I had known.\n\n\"Wayne was such a gentleman the whole time.\n\n\"But I'm not sure his wife would be happy to hear he stripped to his underpants\nin a hot tub in front of women.\"\n\njames.beal@the-sun.co.uk",

Her changing moods affect us all.\n\nHe doesn't work and he sleeps and farts on the sofa all day. He constantly\ncadges our cigarettes. He eats our food and takes our housemate's credit card to\nbuy stuff but only ever for himself. He uses our washing machine and watches TV\nwithout contributing to any bills. Our flatmate used to be highly motivated and\nenergetic but now she is a lazy couch potato like him.\n\nTheir relationship is very unhealthy but she does not seem to care.\n\n0 Deidre SAYS: It is her choice to see him but you do not have to accept a\nhousemate being forced on you all.\n\nTell them together that he must start to pay his way.

            "content_plain": "Dear Deidre MY fiancée's father wants to come and stay - but he hates pets of\nall kinds and kicks our two dogs whenever he gets the chance.\n\nHe is a difficult man and drinks too much. When my fiancée was little, they\nfound a litter of kittens in the garden and he drowned them all.\n\nI am 24. My girlfriend is 23 and is expecting our first child soon. I think this\nis why her dad wants to stay, because we haven't seen him for two years.\n\nI want to get on well with my fiancée's family. Her parents are divorced, so her\nmum won't be visiting with him. Otherwise, I could ask her to keep watch on him.\n\nI don't lose my temper easily but I love our two dogs. They are well behaved and\nI don't know if I could hold myself back from belting this man if he tried to\nhurt them.\n\n? DEIDRE SAYS: Does your girlfriend actually want her dad to come to stay? She\nhas a choice, especially if he is a difficult drunk. You can say no together.\n\nIf she truly does want to see him, tell him beforehand that he must not upset\nyour dogs - or you. Watch carefully and, whenever possible, keep a closed door\nbetween her dad and your dogs.\n\nIf he really has a drink problem, though, alcohol may undo everyone's best\nintentions - and then you'd best insist he leave.\n\nDear Deidre I AM at the end of my tether. I have two sons and a daughter. The\nboys hate one another.\n\nThere is never a moment's peace in our home. They have to share a room but\notherwise I have to separate them all the time. They are 12 and 13. My daughter\nis just nine.\n\nBoth the boys have had problems at school. I'm 37 and have to deal with this\nmyself, as my husband and I live apart. He sees the children when he can.\n\nThe eldest one seems angry with the world just about all the time. He can be\naggressive and rude to adults and to his teachers. When he is annoyed about\nsomething, he cannot let it go. I also worry that my daughter is being affected\nby the turmoil - but I don't know how to keep them happy.\n\n0 Deidre SAYS: Children tend to learn about adult relationships from their own\nparents' behaviour - especially the same-sex parent. How was your break-up? Why\nisn't their dad making the effort to see the children regularly? Unless there is\nsome reason why he shouldn't see more of the children, especially his sons, talk\nto your husband.\n\nSay he needs to see more of the boys so they feel valued and important to him.\nIt could make so much difference to how they value themselves.\n\nMy e-leaflet Stressed With The Kids? should help.",

My husband is a good person but\ndoes not give me what I truly need and does not make me happy.\n\nWe have come to realise that we are not well matched and we lead pretty separate\nlives but still live in the same house.\n\nI am 34, he is 35 and we have a daughter of 11 and a son of nine. They are\nunaware of our troubles because we don't argue and we do a lot as a family.\n\nI realised that part of finding myself was to understand what I need in a\nrelationship. I started to explore the idea that I might be submissive, in all\naspects of a relationship including sexually.\n\nI met a man online who swept me off my feet. He is 39 and in a hollow marriage\nrather like mine. I felt I'd met my soulmate.\n\nNever before had I enjoyed so much variety in the bedroom and had so much fun\nsocially. He may have taken me a bit out of my comfort zone but he is just\nperfect for me. We manage to meet in a hotel most weeks.\n\nBut today while he was in the shower I saw that he was still logged in to his\nemail on my laptop. I didn't plan to snoop but saw he had signed up to a gay sex\nsite, looking to meet men.\n\nI have asked him before whether he is bisexual and he said no, but I am broken.\nI thought he was perfect but he is not the man I thought I knew.\n\nI haven't said anything to him yet. If I speak to him about it I know he will\nsay that it does not affect his feelings for me, and I do not need to know about\nit.\n\nThis man has given me the most amazing, exciting months of my life but can I\naccept that? He is very open-minded sexually and thinks it is normal to involve\nother people in your sex life so he probably doesn't think that would be\ncheating. I'm still married anyway, so how can I complain about cheating? 0\nDeidre SAYS: This has been an exciting adventure for you, but this man doesn't\ncare for you in any meaningful, lasting way.\n\nHe is using you to pursue his own agenda of pushing the sexual boundaries and\nwill always put his wants before your needs.\n\nTruth is, your self-esteem will be pushed lower and lower the longer you keep\nseeing him, quite apart from the risk to your sexual health.\n\nI know you say your marriage is hollow but better settle it one way or the other\nthan let your children think your lack of deep love for each other is normal.\nYou may not argue but they will pick up on the lack of passion.\n\nStop seeing your lover, organise a sexual health check and tell your husband\nit's crunch time - either you rebuild your love for one another or separate so\nyou're both free to find genuinely caring partners.\n\nMy e-leaflet Your Relationship MOT can help you give your marriage the best\nchance.",

It found 36\nincidents alone happened on the Isle of Thanet in Kent. There were also 41\nothers elsewhere.\n\nA report said: \"By February 2019 multiple incidents had been recorded. Two were\ndeclared serious incidents as they potentially led to harm.\"\n\nOne potential cause was setting the sat nav to \"lorry mode\" which sent them on\n\"incompatible\" routes. Crews have since been advised to use local knowledge,\nfollow road signs and only use sat navs for the last part of a journey.\n\nA SECAmb spokesman said of the serious incidents: \"While GPS was a contributory\nfactor, it has been judged no harm occurred as a result.\"\n\nThey added: \"The occurrence of GPS incidents has started to reduce and we are\nclosely monitoring the issue.\"",

            "content_plain": "STRICTLY'S Craig Revel Horwood issued a grovelling apology last night after\nsaying celebs should sleep with their pro partners like Stacey Dooley to win.\n\nThe acid-tongued judge, 54, admitted he had made a \"huge error\" and he deeply\nregretted his \"hurtful\" jibe, made during filming on Friday night.\n\nLast year's champ Stacey  now dating former dance partner Kevin Clifton  was\nsitting in the audience with her family at the time. Filming was halted as aides\nrushed over to them, but her mum Di stormed from the Strictly studio.\n\nBBC sources said Craig was savaged by bosses for the \"totally unacceptable\"\nremark  and ordered to apologise.\n\nCraig said last night: \"I'm deeply sorry for the offence caused to Kevin and\nStacey and everyone who works on the show.\n\n\"I recognise that what I said was hurtful, cruel and incredibly disrespectful.\nIt was a huge error of judgment that I very much regret.\"\n\nIt came after reigning champions Stacey and Kevin took to the ballroom floor\nduring filming for the pre-recorded launch show, which will be aired next\nweekend.\n\nFollowing their performance, host Tess Daly asked the panel  Craig, Bruno\nTonioli, Shirley Ballas and newcomer Motsi Mabuse  for their advice to this\nyear's contestants.\n\nCraig initially told her the wannabes should be inspired by documentary-maker\nStacey, 32.\n\nHe said she had been \"dragged up from the dance gutter\" before winning the show.\n\nBut he then added spitefully: \"Of course, if you sleep with your dance partner\nthat helps...\"\n\nSources said the snide remark sent shockwaves around the studio, and horrified\nbosses immediately called for filming to be halted.\n\nWorried aides flocked to Stacey and her family while executive producers\nimmediately decided to scrap the footage.\n\nThe hosts, panel and audience were then asked to return to their places to\nrefilm the sequence.\n\nOne source said: \"It was an awful moment. Craig was obviously trying to be\nfunny, but realised as soon as he said it that he had gone too far.\n\n\"The audience was visibly shocked, as was Tess Daly and the other judges.\n\n\"Immediately after he made the comment, 'cut' was called, and chaos broke out.\n\n\"Several aides rushed over to Stacey and her family to check if they were OK.\nThey were all stunned, and Stacey's mum obviously wasn't OK at all.\n\n\"She looked very upset, and soon after that she left the studio.\n\n\"The bosses were absolutely furious with Craig and wasted no time in taking him\nto one side afterwards and telling him the remark was totally unacceptable.\n\n\"They encouraged him to make a full apology to Stacey and Kevin, which he was\nhappy to do.\n\n\"He knows that what he said was completely out of line.\"\n\nThe launch show for this year's series will be screened on BBC1 next Saturday.\n\nDays before filming, Stacey had shared her excitement about returning to\nStrictly on social media with a series of photographs backstage. One, showing\nher having her hair done, was retweeted by proud mum Di.\n\nAnd boyfriend Kevin, 36, posted a heart emoji underneath the shot.\n\nThe Sun on Sunday revealed in April how Stacey was secretly dating him after\nditching longterm boyfriend Sam Tucknott. The pair were said to have grown close\nwhile filming the show, with their on-screen chemistry helping them sail through\nto the final last December.\n\nAfter winning the trophy, Stacey gushed about her partner: \"I should say\nsomething quite poignant, shouldn't I? You know how highly I think of you. I\nthink you are the biggest gem. It's no surprise you have been in the final as\nmany times as you have.\n\n\"It's daunting doing something you haven't done before. But he's so patient and\nhe walks you through. You so deserve this.\"\n\nKevin replied: \"Thank you so much, not just for being so amazing and for dancing\nso well, but for being the most wonderful person to work with, to spend every\nday training with.\n\n\"You've worked so hard. You are so lovely and I think the absolute world of\nyou.\"\n\nKevin supported Stacey as she performed on the Strictly Come Dancing Live tour \ndespite not taking part himself. In January they were seen apparently sharing a\nhotel date in Birmingham.\n\nStacey and personal trainer Sam, 30, ended their five-year relationship in\nMarch.\n\nBut Sam got a shock when the pair cleared out their Brighton flat on April 1. He\nspotted a text from Kevin on Stacey's phone which read: \"I love you.\"\n\nStacey, who has a £250,000-ayear golden handcuffs deal with the BBC, later\ntexted Sam to insist she had only fallen for Kevin once the couple had\nseparated.\n\nBut her explanation failed to reassure Sam, who branded Kevin a \"rat\" and a\n\"snake\".\n\nStacey and Kevin's relationship has since gone from strength to strength. In\nJuly, Stacey broke her silence on the romance to gush about \"amazing\" Kevin \nwho was previously married to Strictly pro Karen Clifton.\n\nShe told a newspaper: \"What I am happy to say is, 'Kev's amazing, I'm happy,\nlife happens, I've got an amazing career and I'm very lucky.'\" A BBC source said\nlast night of the judge's comment: \"Craig was told in no uncertain terms that\nthis was completely unacceptable.\n\n\"It goes against everything the show stands for and it's right that he's issued\na full apology.\"\n\nlaura.armstrong@the-sun.co.uk The Sun on Sunday Says  Page 16 WHAT HE SAID TO\nTESS 6Stacey was dragged up from the dance gutter..of course, if you sleep with\nyour dance partner that helps7",

It was emotional.\n\n\"Even coming off the pitch I was emotional, thinking it will be my last time\nhere and the last time going down Westgate Street to the stadium.\n\n\"It's a special nation with special people who are very passionate and very\nkind.\"\n\nJack Carty booted Ireland into a ninth-minute lead after new Wales skipper Josh\nNavidi handled the ball on the floor at a ruck before Jarrod Evans levelled with\na simple penalty.\n\nThen Ireland's flyers combined to give their side lift-off.\n\nWill Addison soared to claim a high ball before Andrew Conway went racing away\non a mazy cross-field run to give the scoring pass for Jacob Stockdale to stroll\nover in the corner.\n\nStockdale made it a double after 28 minutes when he pounced to scoop up Aaron\nShingler's loose offload and race to the line to make it 15-3. Ireland's pack\nwere smashing Wales in the scrum and were eventually rewarded with a penalty try\nafter Leon Brown was sent to the sin-bin for repeat offending.\n\nBut Wales' debut star Lane showed shades of George North as he powered past the\ncovering defence to score at the corner and narrow the gap to 12 points. The\ncomeback was on when Patchell sidestepped his way over with five minutes to go\nbut it was too little too late as Ireland held on to claim victory.",

Tim Paine (left) and Co know they should be walking out in\nWednesday's Fourth Test at Old Trafford with The Ashes already retained.\nMomentum is all with England and the Aussies are unsure of their line-up, or the\nsort of cricket they want to play. Even England losing James Anderson for the\nfinal two Tests does not alter the fact Australia face many more questions than\nthe hosts.\n\nEngland's only real issue is whether to bring in Sam Curran for Chris Woakes.\n\nDilemma No 1 for the Aussies, who beat Derbyshire by an innings and 54 runs in a\nwarm-up match yesterday, is who to drop to accommodate the returning Steve\nSmith.\n\nMarcus Harris, Usman Khawaja and Matthew Wade are in the firing line as Marnus\nLabuschagne  Smith's initial concussion sub  boasts three half-centuries in\nthree innings, so will keep his place.\n\nAnd Smith, wearing a stem guard neck protector for the first time, scored 23\nagainst Derbyshire on Friday. It was his first innings since being KO'd by a\nJofra Archer bouncer.\n\nOne Aussie option is to include big-hitting all-rounder Mitchell Marsh  the\nclosest they have to a Stokes.\n\nBut the tourists also have a bowling dilemma having so far overlooked Mitchell\nStarc, leading wicket-taker at the World Cup.\n\nThe Aussie paceman will surely play at Old Trafford now.

But\ncoaching the tourists was a New Zealander called Ged Stokes  father of a\ncertain Ben  who spent one season in 1982 playing for Workington.\n\nSo, in 2002, with the Cumbrian club on the lookout for a new coach, director\nDave Smith and pal Vic Semple  who did the strapping for the team  decided to\ntake a punt.\n\nJumping in the car, they headed 120 miles south for the meeting which, two\ndecades later, has had such far-reaching consequences.\n\nSemple, who is now nearly 75 but still doing the strapping at Whitehaven rugby\nleague club, looked back on that fateful day.\n\nHe said: \"I'm not even sure if Ged knew we were coming, quite possibly not. We\njust decided to sound him out because he'd had a season over here as a player.\n\n\"We wanted to ask him if he ever planned to come back.\n\n\"Sometimes you just have to be cheeky  and he took to us straightaway as\nCumbrians.\n\n\"He was keen and that was that. They came over just before Christmas, it's\nunbelievable how it all turned out.\"\n\nSemple grew so close to Stokes that when his time at Workington came to an end\nafter four years, he quit to work with him at Whitehaven.\n\nIndeed, the families remain such good pals that Semple was a guest at Ben's\nwedding and his children's christenings. And as the nation was gripped by that\nsensational match-winning innings in last week's Third Test, there were few\nprouder people around  even if Semple could not get to TV to see it!\n\nHe added: \"Last Sunday we were all at Cockermouth Rugby Union club for a\nfund-raising day, so we couldn't see the television coverage.\n\n\"Everyone had their phones out, keeping up with what was happening at\nHeadingley. It was an incredible day and there were quite a few drinks taken,\neveryone was so delighted for him. \"Ben had actually played a bit of rugby\nleague as a kid for a club called Broughton Rose  but there was obviously\nalways cricket, he was so good.\n\n\"He was up here a couple of months ago and he is exactly the same. He's still\nthe Ben we've known and loved all those years.\"",

Every day I wake up and I can breathe,\nI'm not out of breath.\n\n\"Before I was really struggling and relying on inhalers. It really feels like a\nmiracle.\"\n\nMargaret is among ten patients taking part in trials.\n\nAround a million people in Britain suffer heart failure  a condition in which\nthe heart becomes too weak to pump blood around the body properly. It is the\nleading cause of hospital admissions for over-65s.\n\nThe device, the world's first in-heart microcomputer, is made by Israeli firm\nVectorious. It claims if the device was rolled out nationally here it could help\nkeep thousands out of hospital.\n\nCurrently, NHS treatment for heart patients only changes once they suffer from\nworsening symptoms.\n\nThe trial of the device was announced ahead of the European Society of\nCardiology conference in Paris.\n\nExperts said the \"batteryless\" technology should last a lifetime. It is said to\nbe the most accurate form of home heart monitoring yet available.\n\nEach day patients place a strap across their chest for five minutes.\n\nIt sends the results to a hospital team, flagging any problems to medics so they\ncan intervene much earlier.\n\nCurrently, if doctors want to check changes to heart signs patients must first\nbe admitted to hospital.\n\nResearcher Prof Francisco Leyva, consultant cardiologist at Queen Elizabeth\nHospital in Birmingham, said: \"This new device has the potential to combat three\nof the biggest problems relating to heart failure disease  low patient quality\nof life, repeat admissions to hospital and the astronomical cost to the system\nof readmissions.\" Nearly half of heart failure patients end up back in hospital\nafter initial treatment. Oren Goldshtien, head of Vectorious, said: \"We believe\nthe monitor is a game changer in helping the million people living with heart\nfailure in the UK take control and manage their disease.\"\n\nnick.mcdermott @the-sun.co.uk",

Tellingly, the\nlast time one of her records featured on BGT was in May 2017  a month before\nthe Grenfell Tower fire.\n\nOn The X Factor, her songs  previously a staple of the show  have not featured\nsince the blaze.\n\nThe Tottenham-born singer famously showed up to the tower block wreckage in West\nLondon 24 hours after the tragedy.\n\nBut she refused to appear on Cowell's star-studded charity single, a re-working\nof Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water. Last night a source told\nThe Sun on Sunday: \"Simon put his heart and soul into that recording, and used\nup a lot of favours getting so many big names to lend their voices and give up\ntheir time for free.\n\n\"He saw Adele down at Grenfell and assumed she'd leap at the chance to help\nraise more funds.\n\n\"Unfortunately negotiations came to a grinding halt, and she declined to take\npart.\n\n\"Understandably Simon was frustrated, and as a result currently refuses to play\nany of her songs on his shows.\n\n\"Say what you like about Simon, he's a genuine guy. If Adele wouldn't help him\nout, then he's not going to boost her album sales by playing her tracks.\n\n\"The stats speak for themselves  whilst pre-2017 Adele was a staple on The X\nFactor, her tunes haven't appeared post-Grenfell.\n\n\"Clearly Adele is no longer in vogue with Simon or his creative team.\"\n\nSongs penned by Adele used to be a popular choice among contestants on Cowell's\nITV shows.\n\nIn 2011 then-judge Louis Walsh tried to ban X Factor wannabes from singing Adele\ntracks at auditions because so many were doing them.\n\nPast winners James Arthur, 31, and Sam Bailey, 42, were among those to perform\nher songs.\n\nBut the last person to sing one was Ryan Lawrie in October 2016.\n\nAdele herself has not appeared on it since December 2015.\n\nIn May 2017, BGT hopeful Kyle Tomlinson belted out Rolling In The Deep  the\nlast time one of her songs has featured on the show.\n\nIndustry experts previously claimed Adele's chart success has been helped by The\nX Factor.\n\nStars including Robbie Williams, Liam Payne, Rita Ora, James Blunt and Stormzy\nall appeared on Cowell's single, released a week after the devastating fire\nkilled 72 people.\n\nclementine.moodie@thesun.co.uk",

It\nwas an A-plus performance.\n\n\"When you have more variety yourself, you can handle the variety of opponents\nbecause you have different options on different shots.\n\n\"It seems like she's playing more on instinct now  she knows what she wants to\ndo and doesn't have to think about it.\n\n\"Because of that I think she's cut out the unforced errors.\"\n\nPliskova, like Konta, is a big hitter and their fourth-round clash promises to\nbe explosive. The last time they met was in the final of the Italian Open in\nRome in May. The big-serving Czech, 27, was triumphant on that occasion but\nKonta reckons she has improved since then.\n\nThe world No 16 has looked great at Flushing Meadows and fears no one as the\n28-year-old aims to reach the last eight in the Big Apple for the first time.\n\nKonta, who failed to get past the second round of any Major in 2018, said: \"I'd\nlike to think that I've even grown as a player since Rome, as well.\n\n\"I am actually looking forward to seeing how I can do a bit better, how I can\njust maybe ask some better questions this time around.\n\n\"I don't think there's any specific magic click or pill or anything.\n\n\"But I feel I've been giving myself every opportunity possible to get better and\ngrow.\n\n\"From a big-picture perspective, I've played a lot of matches this year but I\nfeel good.\"",
